1001417,69924,2009-12-09,5,"Very, very good.  A welcome change from mayo based dressing.  I used it with one bag of prepared slaw and it was plenty.  I cut down on the sugar a little and don't think it hurt it a bit."
186855,450108,2011-10-10,4,"I've never made dressing with bread cubes before, so this was new for me.  It was very easy to make and we did enjoy the flavour.  I used 'freeze-dried' poultry seasoning, and found it wasn't as strong as the regular 'ground' version, so the flavour could have been a little stronger.  Next time I'll used 'ground', or increase the 'freeze-dried' seasoning.  I did add the celery to the onion mixture before adding the bread, but that was the only thing I did differently.  I'll certainly be making this again for the Christmas bird.  Many thanks Alvina.  Made for Fall PAC 2011."
1169937,337526,2009-07-29,5,"I usually just dice mango and avocado for salad.  It never occurred to me to throw them both in a blender.  Yummy, light refreshing dessert for summer with no added sugar.  Great for kids."
717221,112526,2008-05-17,5,"So tasty! Wouldn't change a thing. Made 1/2 spicy with chilies and 1/2 without for my non-spicy friend - both lovely. Have made twice already, and once had to leave assembled enchiladas with cream poured over in foil covered dishes in the fridge for 3 days! due to unforseen circumstances. These were still great only baking three days later. Thanks for a lovely, easy and tasty recipe."
191641,185342,2009-09-12,5,Really good.  The parmesan cheese added a nice flavour and didn't add too many calories.  Good recipe.
865653,86866,2010-03-25,0,"Wow, these did not turn out for me.  I don't know what went wrong, but it seems like it needed a lot more flour to make a dough, mine was more like a batter!  Not sure if I'll even try them again."
772114,231964,2008-02-22,5,Turned out Great!!. Made it twice so far.
593513,154288,2010-12-23,5,"I only used the sage butter sauce on this recipe. I had used a pumpkin ricotta mixture in my raviolis. I love using won ton wrappers for these because it makes it so much quicker and the flavor is excellent. I didn't have any problems with making them or boiling them, they stayed intact. Then I simmered them in the sauce. Sage butter sauce goes so well with pumpkin raviolis. They were like eating little pillows of delight. Thanks for sharing your recipe Queen!!"
2001462184,90000,2017-03-29,5,Family Favorite. For a low carb version cauliflower mash has a consistency very close to grits.
653438,180465,2013-02-14,5,Made for February Sun and Spice Event and I am soooo glad I did.  DH was gone at lunch time and so I made this and used fresh mozzarella cheese and ohhh it melted so nicely and with the herbs it made the sandwich.  This is going into my Favorites of 2013.
917666,282336,2008-11-09,3,"If you prefer a crunchier cookie, you should like these.  I like my cookies to be a bit softer, so if I make these again, I will take the suggestion below and add a bit more butter to the recipe.  Being able to change the color of the M&M for the occasion was fun.  Thanks for posting the recipe!"
373018,54257,2009-01-21,4,"I'm not a fan of meatloaf at all, but my DH was having a craving so I thought I'd make him one and chose this one because of the high reviews, that many people can't be wrong.  :-)  It was indeed very good!  I even ate 2 slices, I haven't eaten meatloaf in 30 years."
285039,192548,2007-02-19,5,"My husband would give this 6 stars if it was possible!  I used a 3 pound pork loin roast, and prepackaged slaw mix and it turned out fantastic. Thanks for posting; it was yummy!"
42236512,114558,2015-02-08,0,Loved it but I used beef and beef broth and it was wonderful!!!!
2001855232,272691,2017-12-12,5,"This is basically how I make mine, except my family always used Pecorino Romano also. Since I come from a family of hunters, and both my boys and husband hunt, make them with Venison minute steaks. No one knows and I think they are even better! Everyone loves!"
246712,43824,2005-10-24,3,I didn't  really like this - I found it very eggy tasting. The topping was very nice however and the idea is cool. I may tweak with this recipe to make it more to my liking. 
507071,92110,2009-02-04,5,"Fantastic!  I made just 1 thick chop, used a whole shallot, 1 tbsp oil and half the broth and vinegar... it was delicious, and surprisingly calorie friendly!"
844554,104312,2009-07-07,5,"OH MY!! WERE THESE GREAT!! If I could give 10 stars for taste, I would. I used whole wheat flour tortillas, reduced fat cheese, added pinto beans, a can of mexicorn and cumin. These were so, so tasty. Definitely the enchilada sauce makes this dish. We had it with brown rice and I made it in a 8x8 square dish and froze the remainder for future meals. I'll definitely make this one over and over. Thanks so much!"
178427,286209,2010-05-31,5,"Very good indeed! I used the new individual layered lumpia wrappers and it was a breeze to make. We liked everything about these lumpia...great taste, good looking and easy to make. Thanks for sharing. Made for ZWT 6."
240425,12591,2005-09-08,5,This is the first angle food cake.  I only had 7 eggs on hand so I made the five remaining egg whites from Wilton Meringue Powder and water. (2 tsp powder to 2 Tbsp water makes 1 egg white).  I also baked this in a stone bundt pan.  I was very pleased with how it turned out.  I am not big on almond flavor so next time I will only use 1/4 tsp of almond flavor.  This will absolutly be made again
383346,231700,2012-05-02,3,I tried using less dressing so that the meat would be better to work with but DH still have trouble with it on the bbq.  It was falling apart.  The only one that look good was for the photo.  But the taste is really good.  Maybe an egg would help but still using less bbq sauce and dressing.  Thanks Crystal :)  Made for Bargain Basement tag game
28455,31163,2002-08-05,5,EXACTLY how my grandma made hers too! I love these I am glad someone posted this also because I had forgotten them and I always loved these! thank you:)
1809367,244910,2011-02-08,5,"This was so delicious!  I got nervous because I cheated and tasted it before it was cooked and it wasn't too exciting, but it ended up SO good!  This in the handmade pasta that I tried out for the first time and its my new favorite food.  I used a little more than half of the filling and got about 35 small raviolis.  Thank you for sharing, it made for a wonderful family dinner!"
1168148,39087,2010-08-31,5,Cooked this for my whole family last Saturday and everybody loved even if i did not have any doubt after all the reviews there were listed. I made no additions or substitutions and your recipe as written is perfect for our tastes and the sauce came out so rich and tasty.Thanks for the recipe
2748284,10837,2013-09-12,5,I never knew homemade spaghetti sauce was so easy! After the sauce had simmered for two hours I added a pound of sliced fresh mushrooms and a pound of browned ground sausage. We ate it over spaghetti squash and it was delicious!
49304,53015,2003-02-08,5,"Delicious, we really liked the stew, very easy to make. we love cabbage and this another good way to fix it. I had ham slices frozen in freezer. Served it with a green salad with fruit.Thank you for the recipe."
207519,131473,2005-07-28,5,"Are you kidding me? This is one of the best alfredo recipes I have ever tasted! I did add some canned mushrooms, which made it, OH!, even more delicious! I think the garlic really hit the spot with this alfredo! Excellent posting, will use this recipe ONLY from now on!"
25356,38569,2005-04-20,5,"Yum! I have eaten soo much of this stuff since I made it yesterday afternoon. I can't wait to make another one...next time...strawberry! :D
Thanks!"
593927,373540,2012-05-20,5,"DH and DD1 both say this is good and I made it for my FIL`s dewaniya  (male gathering) and I'm sure it will get eaten up. It is a nice change from their regular favourite, recipe#213305 as this one has a cakier texture and the lemon zest. I did not use all the 'asl' syrup as the men don't like too much sweetness. In fact I made a batch of recipe#451788 with the leftover syrup. I use Cedar brand semolina (light coloured, not durum semolina used for making pasta), the shredded coconut I had was sweetened so I left out most of the sugar, I used mainly canola oil and the rest unrefined sunflower oil as I was afraid it would have too much of a sunflower taste, alcohol free vanilla from the health food shop, just 1 tbs orange blossom water, plus the rest of the ingredients. I cut them into diamond shapes to look very nice masha Allah. I may make this again as a change from the usual. Made for Welcome to Algeria!"
66899,53252,2003-03-24,3,these were interesting- i love the apple and cheese combination.  they did not rise very well and were a bit greasy but they were very moist from the apple sauce.  
268973,201149,2007-03-23,5,These were delicious and came out soooo soft and chewy.  I made them for work and everyone loved them.
217657,159994,2006-08-14,5,This was just plain yummy!!!  Loved the difference the almond extract gave it to other honey butters...I recommend this with french toast and peach syrup!
230167,76470,2008-01-07,5,This has a nice kick to it. I used small shrimp and added it to an Alfredo sauce over cheese tortellini.  Delish! Zero left-overs. DH approved.
565276,13619,2007-10-14,5,"The very fact that I made a decent pie crust says volumes about this recipe!  I can book/bake nearly everything else... but NOT a pie crust.  I didn't have enough shortening, so I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening, and I did do it all in a food processor, but it was still really good!  Thank you!"
2960696,56366,2013-08-26,3,"I made this soup as specified, except I left out the added salt, since many of the ingredients are already salty. (Onion soup mix, soy sauce.) It was still VERY salty. I also took other people&#039;s advice and cooked the pasta on the side to add to each portion as needed and avoid sogginess. I used some of the pasta water to add to the soup to make it less salty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the plus side, it is very easy and the flavour is nice once you cut the salt. Hearty and good texture. With the added liquid and pasta on the side, I&#039;d give it four stars."
17803,220016,2008-01-17,5,Yum!  I used the large tortillas with my quesadilla maker.  There was enough chicken mixture to make 5 but I did use 1 extra cup of cheese.  I used the salsa I made last year Recipe #9272.  Makes a fast meal after a long day.  Thank you  Made for *Zaar Tag*  game 2008
37779,110805,2013-01-18,5,"Cauliflower is a hard sell at my house. But I keep trying. This one really went over well. I have to admit, I was surprised at how good this was. Roasting is the way to go--great flavor and texture with very simple seasonings. Thanks, Barb, for another great recipe."
106501,26794,2004-10-31,5,Oh wow!!! This is yummy!  Made a batch for me & dh to have with mean's pulled pork.  I made half with the preserves (because I like it sweet) and half without (cause dh don't) and it was just too yummy.  Me & dh were both thrilled with our sauces.  Thanks!!
149043,91298,2004-09-26,5,"This has a little bite to it after it melds for awhile.  Very tasty.  We ate it in whole wheat sandwiches, on crackers and with a spoon straight out of the bowl!  Thanks for sharing this recipe and congratulations on winning the football pool!"
110125,101677,2004-11-03,5,"What a fun and easy appetizer for Halloween!  For a serving tray I used the bottom of the egg carton, placed parsley on it and the eggs nested on top."
1800235799,281701,2013-11-12,5,"I revised this recipe somewhat by browning the chicken thighs before putting them in the slow cooker (use diced tomatoes that are pure tomatoes -- no added salt or sugar). It did triple the prep time. At the one hour mark, I also added artichokes and sliced mushrooms, cooked for 4.5 more hours on low and then served it over eggplant squash that was shredded. Delicious, healthy and very low calorie! It&#039;s also Paleo friendly."
37449,420705,2012-06-13,5,"Yum, delicious hummus! I just ate this out of the bowl. Thanks! Made for Vegetarian Tag, June 2012."
284897,286396,2010-02-16,5,"Great recipe.
I did make a few chages...only a few, I only had white rice so used this instead, and I baked my patties in the oven. I used a well greased baking tray, and cooked them in the oven ....very carefuly turniing them once during cooking. I thought they might break apart, but armed with my trusty egg flip..... I had no problems at all! I didn't break one!
I cut down on the relish and halved it,  but followed the relish recipe as  it as written. It was fantastic, creamy and sweet!
DS and DH ate these and they don't often eat zucchini, but DS did suggest they would be nice with some cheese in them, but I don't think they would hold together as well.
Thanks F.C. for a great way to use up a couple (or in my case 1 large zucchin!)"
1802758810,230524,2014-09-08,5,"This was great! I doubled the recipe for base and put half in 1 9x13 pan and other half in another 9x13 pan lined with parchment paper. After freezing, parchment paper made it real easy to flip the other base on as top layer. I used 2 litres ice cream. Made a nice thick yummy sandwich."
534885,101769,2007-12-04,5,"Excellent, just like my grandmother used to make here in Texas."
219733,129988,2006-06-04,5,"This cake is lovely...its almost not like a cake, but a firmer chocolate moose with crunchy bits of biscuits in it...I too used Bahlsen Leibniz butter biscuits...I omitted the coffee and rum, cos I was afraid it might be a tad too bitter. Lovely lovely lovely!!!

469903,304213,2008-06-22,5,"Wowsers! I made as directed and boy was this one HOT salad! The pepper laden dressing is full of flavor and goes very well with the mellow flavors of the mango and avocado. Wonderful exciting salad! I did reduce the olive oil to 2 tablespoons, but kept the other amounts as stated. Made for ZWT4."
2001854747,276954,2018-07-18,3,I used only beef and lamb total of 2 pounds of meat. Adjusted seasoning but it was way too salty after using only 1/4 cup of boullion
350750,48014,2014-01-10,5,"What a winner this soup is!  We really liked this, it was different than other soups we eat.  Thank you!"
178427,63689,2009-12-28,5,"I can't believe I forgot to review this fabulous recipe. I've been making this twice a month for over 2 years and we just love it. Everytime I take burger meat out I ask how they want it and they holler ""make those sloppy joe's"". I never vary from the recipe because it's perfect just as written. Thanks for sharing one of the best recipes I've ever found."
527607,513746,2014-09-21,5,I loved these. I enjoyed the tomato on them but think good old sour cream would work too
28087,423918,2010-06-06,5,"Absolutely Wonderful Quiche!!! Great rich flavor :) I made this in a deep dish pie pan and had to adjust the cooking times, about 35 minutes covered and an additional 15 minutes uncovered, until center was set. This a keeper and will go into my breakfast/brunch rotation. Thanks for posting. *Made for SSaSSy's ZWT 6*"
1117099,2886,2010-01-03,4,"Great recipe1 Although with 4 bananas it was really wet when done, I may try with less banana next time. All in all great tasting!"
174096,305343,2009-02-02,5,"So easy and refreshing!  This was great.  I get tired of the same old salads, so this will be a great way to change up the rotation.  Thanks for sharing!"
272752,142126,2006-10-08,5,"I can't believe I'm the first one to review these!  Hail Burrito indeed -- these were fabulous, with the spicy sauce, the sweet potatos, and the hearty black beans and crunchy plantains and onions all contrasting and working together beautifully.  Used whole wheat tortillas, which helped as well.  I subtract one star for imprecise amounts (2 plaintains and 2 sweet potatos would be easier) and somewhat unclear directions, which made me cautious.  But overall, HAIL BURRRRIIIITOOOO!"
2000730112,524863,2015-12-05,5,I don&#039;t do much cooking these days but this sounds so good and looks so great that I think I&#039;ll try it tonight. I&#039;m going shopping today so this works well.
280271,129682,2008-04-19,5,"Excellent flavor! The chops came out tender and moist. Really enjoyed the touch of orange taste. Nothing was overpowering. All the ingredients blended well together. Due to the weather outside I cooked them on my George Foreman grill. Wonderful recipe, thanks for posting."
158449,194597,2007-07-09,5,"These were so good, makes 12 BIG muffins! I didn't have an apple, but I had some homemade chunky applesauce, so I strained it a bit and used about 2/3 cup total applesauce. Used golden raisins and skipped the nuts. These were exactly what I was looking for, great for breakfast and toddlers who won't eat carrots!"
246482,82373,2007-06-13,5,"Very moist chicken and tasty. I will use unsweetened pineapple juice the next time as I found it a wee bit sweet, but that didnt stop me from finishing the pan.
Served with noodles and a vegetable."
15572,71430,2008-05-31,3,"It was very tender, I don't know what I did wrong, but the meat was not very tasty.  But don't let this review stop you from trying it.  I could have goofed something.  Perhaps a dash of ground cloves."
262129,81687,2006-01-02,5,"I couldn't eat it myself (allergies) but boy was it a hit!  I used fresh strawberries, sliced and soaked in triple sec.  I put that in the middle of 2 layers (I baked them on jellyroll pans), and then frosted the whole thing with the cool whip icing and fresh berries.  What a great trick the pudding is!  Thank you so much for an easy, beautiful dessert."
294703,136692,2006-02-18,5,"These were delicious!  I would suggest using thick bacon strips so they are equally done liek the scallops. I didn't make your pasta, I wanted an alfredo this time but next time I will.  Mushrooms would tast good with this."
188066,204629,2008-10-06,5,"Wow! the rub made this steak fantastic. I added some granulated garlic, about half a teaspoon because i tripled this recipe. It was a little smokey in the kitchen but not too bad, heck the smoke alarms didn't even go off! Always a bonus! I needed to cook the staeks a little longer to get to medium rare, but mine were very thick. an excellent recipe, will be making steak this way again and again."
63026,38339,2003-06-25,5,"Wow! This tasted EXACTLY like the Wendy's Mandarin Chicken salad. The dressing was perfect. I didn't have iceberg or red leaf lettuce, so substituted Romaine with equal success."
104295,335416,2009-02-16,4,"We enjoyed this.  I did make the stock with the ham bone and am not sure it added much taste.  Also, the recipe never says when to add the ham back into the soup.  I also used more than 4 cups of water because 4 cups wouldn't cover my large bone.  I found the meat that was on the bone and had boiled was much too tough, so I used a bag of frozen ham (from the same ham).  I also used skim milk (which is all I had in the house) and it curdled slightly, but still tasted fine.  I intend to add some cooked broccoli and cauliflower to it tomorrow when I reheat it for lunch."
1660682,272351,2011-02-09,0,"I quartered this recipe, so I only made 1 dozen. I omitted the spices, and they were delicious. Exactly what I was looking for. Not too sweet but chocolatey. I will definitely make these again."
704545,166309,2009-01-20,5,Perfect!!!!  Definitely loved them although hubby wanted a little more mayo added in.
121023,279137,2008-02-07,5,"OH my gosh!!!!
This makes AMAZING shrimp!!!!
I used the shrimp flavorings for my shrimp stir fry and it is wonderful!!
I'm looking forward to using it as you wrote with ramen noodles!

Thanks for a perfect recipe!!"
1213515,175740,2009-11-30,5,"I know this is a Tapas dish and should be eaten with scumptious bread to soak up the juices but I didn't have any so I mixed it with some penne and some arugula leaves. 
Absolutely heavenly!!"
11297,84051,2005-04-19,5,"Thanks for the easy way to make this dish. :) Will be a 'keeper' in my book. 
Cheers :)"
496803,374927,2011-03-24,5,"This was easy, and very good!  I used 2 thighs for two servings, but made the marinade as written.  I saved out a couple of teaspoons of the marinade to add to the coconut milk (which I doubled) to make a sauce for the chicken plus the rice and vegetables I served on the side.  I had to substitute cilantro stems for the roots, as I couldn't find the roots in any of my local markets.  I loved the marinade!  It is exactly the flavors in my favorite restaurant curry, so I can now enjoy that at home.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!"
131126,317937,2008-08-25,4,"I changed several things in order to try the recipe by not using sugar free products.   The crepe cups were a cute idea and very easy to do! I had selected Recipe #19104 and froze crepes to use during the contest.  They thawed & molded wonderfully for this recipe.  In order to make this more s'more like in my mind I elected to use marshmellow cream.  My biggest reservation was the chocolate syrup. I know it was a required contest ingredient, but really think melted chocolate would be better suited in this recipe.  Thank you for your entry in RSC #12."
170628,167202,2007-01-11,5,"This was really good and it was a very big portion for the amount of points.  I love Weight Watchers recipes that my entire family can enjoy and not feel they are on a diet, too.  This was definitely one.  1/4 cup of egg substitute is the same amount of points as one large egg.  So, if you don't have egg substitute, you can substitute a regular egg without changing the points.  Thanks!"
424680,200861,2008-09-24,5,"One change I made was to use steamed fresh green beans instead of the canned, but other than that followed your list of ingredients right on down, & we had a great tasting change of pace in salads! Thanks for a great keeper! [Tagged, made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in the current Pick-A-Chef]"
32143,18387,2008-04-03,4,Very good! I made the filling and sauce the night before so I could quickly put them together after work. Just warmed them up a little in the microwave and had to add a little extra broth to the sauce. Thank-you!
1100340,237183,2011-09-30,0,I made these last night for a  muffin basket for the church bakesale. I used mini chocolate chips instead of white chocolate. They were pretty tasty! & they made over a dozen.I followed the recipe exactly as written though.
246936,19596,2011-01-12,5,"So easy. Could not remember the recipe bu this is what I did and the family loved it. I had 2 chicken breasts, cooked in olive oil, then added the broth (1 can plus a little more of another can),package of mixed veggies and about 2 cups noodles. Let it simmer. Then added the cream of chicken soup. Big hit in the family. Will make it again. And of course I added seasoning to the mix as well. Thanks for an outstanding recipe! :)"
452355,309486,2012-07-12,5,"Made this easy, summery recipe for dinner last night and it did not disappoint.  Halved the recipe with perfect results and had to use fillets versus steaks as that it what I had on hand.  Like another reviewer, we really enjoyed the addition of ginger to the sauce and it really came through in the dish.  Served with grilled asparagus on the side.  This was a great weeknight dish.  Thanks for posting."
783368,27801,2010-02-13,5,We are not big fans of brocolli and my husband is not a big fan of tomatoes - but we both LOVED this.  What a great tasty way to get two really good vegetables in!  Will be making this often - goes great with sandwiches.
800672,3570,2008-06-28,5,This was so good. Made it for my husband who had been asking for rice pudding and he was really impressed. :)
765437,199579,2011-04-08,5,"I needed a Lenten Friday night meal and this was what I decided to try. I used cream of mushroom soup, a 5 oz can of tuna, and monterey jack cheese because that's what I had.<br/>My family had mixed feelings about it. My husband and I both liked it a lot. Only 1 of my 4 kids liked it, but I have a feeling he just really wanted a cupcake for dessert so ate all of his dinner!<br/>I guess maybe it's not that kid friendly with the chunks of celery and onion, and my kids don't really love tuna anyway.<br/>But, it gets 5 stars from the grownup set!!<br/>Thanks for posting."
954129,35889,2010-03-30,5,Excellent recipe to use to make hamburger buns.  We loved the texture and taste!  My go to recipe now!
349750,77397,2007-10-05,5,"This was simply wonderful. I made it for my husband since I am not a fan of cinnamon. This was so good I helped him polish it off in two settings! I did use the egg and used wole milk instead of half and half. Oh, I also omitted nuts since my hubby is not a fan. I really was great. This will be part of my holiday breakfast tradition from here on. Thanks for another GREAT recipe!"
451167,126332,2007-02-16,3,"Yay for 1.8g fiber per brownie! Mine were not crumbly, but I upped the butter to 2T. I will only bake them 23-25 min. next time so they don't dry out (I baked them about 26 min. this time), but the flavor is good and you don't taste the wheat germ.  I even substituted splenda and they turned out OK."
47510,35065,2002-11-12,5,Absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was to substitute walnuts for the pecans.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and the whole family just devoured it.  I think there might have been a small spoonful left...it was that good.
1244997,13467,2009-11-03,5,"Wonderful chicken recipe! I paired this with roasted butternut squash, broccoli and brown rice YUM..what a dinner..Thank You Mirj!"
885058,78707,2008-09-16,5,"Smells great cooking. It's actually in my oven right now. I'm not crazy about the cooking method. Everything is sticking to the pan. I used olive oil as directed. Added some more. Then, sprayed with Pam. Still, everything seems to be sticking and burning. Sounds like a great recipe. I just can't keep it from burning. I will try glass dish next time. Roasting pan means an actual roasting pan...
UPDATE:  I did use a glass dish and it worked perfectly.  A roasting pan is completely different than a glass casserole dish!  Be careful about that!  My hubby loves the potatoes in this mixture so I use extra potatoes.  It tastes great and we've had it several times already.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Just be careful about that roasting pan."
844554,53508,2013-05-22,5,"This was so good that hubby even declared it tasty! You know that&#039;s a winner when your other half speaks up. I used black grapes, walnuts and mayonnaise. Delicious!"
1783373,501856,2014-02-06,5,"Love, Love this fruit salad!  It is so clean and refreshing and a welcome treat especially from all the heavy eating from the holidays.  I used most of the fruits listed except for raspberries (none in the market) and used a little extra honey because my strawberries weren&#039;t quit ripe.  Next time I will use fresh ginger - I bet it would be even better.  I could see this being served at a dinner party after the entree to freshen-up the pallet.  Thank you Nancy&#039;s Pantry for a wonderful new addition to my repertoire of foods to make."
59302,61946,2007-07-08,5,"This was delicious!  I dressed up the ground beef a bit with some finely chopped onion, garlic and bell pepper, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  A big thanks to Cookin' Kayte for mentioning that anything but heavy cream will curdle as I tend to use milk instead of cream in cream sauces.  Just a side note...  In step 4, I browned more onion than was called for and before adding the cream, I moved the extra onion to the pan of green beans I was serving on the side.  The onions added a wonderful flavor to the beans.  This recipe is a real keeper!  Thanks for posting!"
1056692,488437,2015-05-08,5,"YUM!  I cheated cause I didn&#039;t want to have the oven heating up the house today, so I fried these in peanut oil instead.  Kids are thrilled, because we hardly ever eat out so they don&#039;t get fried pickles very often.  Now we can have them at home whenever we want.  I did run out of panko so mixed flour and cornmeal and did some that way...  in the deep fryer, those are equally delish...  wouldn&#039;t work in the oven, tho.  Thanks for sharing!"
89549,36147,2008-10-16,4,"I like this inspirational recipe.  I did make a few personal changes to suit my taste, that's why it's only 4 not 5 stars.  I'm sure it's a 5 star recipe just as it is.  Here's what I did:  I used 3.5 cups water and .5 cups sherry, only 1 cup sugar, cinnamon stick instead of ground, candied ginger slice instead of ground.  I also put in 4 crushed green cardamon pods.  Love to eat these just as they are.  Thank you for the recipe, Miss Annie."
811594,367414,2012-12-05,5,"These are really good, easy and fast.  I'm on my 3rd batch.  I like using the smaller size pan (8x8) or smaller.  I used non-stick foil and sprayed it and and no issues with it sticking.  Also, added 1 tsp vanilla after cooking for 6 minutes and sprinked with kosher salt after pouring in pan.  I put in the freezer for about 20 minutes and then cut, and then put in the freezer again about 10 minutes before wrapping."
337963,137364,2008-08-27,4,This worked out perfectly!  The only change I made was to cut the salt in half.  Thanks Mama!  (Please see my rating system)
133174,230863,2007-06-10,5,This recipe was made for the ZWTIII French Cooking Challenge and was done without wine. For the wine I used chicken broth. The chicken was moist and delicious. Served this over recipe #157876 which complimented the dish nicely. Definately a winning recipe.
232823,71373,2010-02-20,5,"Really tasty!These have somewhat sweet taste, so they just they way bread rolls should be!"
428885,200802,2007-09-01,5,"The ultimated dressing! I have made ""stuffing"" for years. Nothing fancy, but always from scratch etc. This tops em' all! There is not one thing we didn't like about the recipe. Followed this to a ""t"" easy, smells delicious, and tastes even better. Oh there was one thing that was different, the color of the rye bread was light instead of dark, but that had no bearing on taste. I will use this recipe from now on. The cranberries, apples, rye bread, and onions really balance this stuffing out to be just perfect. Thank so much twissis~another winner under your belt. UPDATED To Add: You should make MORE then stated, I am ashamed to admit I ate about 1/4 cup or more all by myself before it hit the table."
935956,323333,2010-11-15,5,"Love it. Fast, inexpensive and versatile. I've used pintos or black beans. Great either way. Serving it with fish tacos tonight."
916394,119415,2009-09-05,5,Amazing
1312320,188214,2009-07-02,5,Excellent and fairly easy - however I completely agree with the review by Manami to reduce the amount of salt.  If you use the salt called for the potato salad is overwhelmingly salty.
173399,77942,2005-03-15,5,"My mom makes fish like this!!!  I never realized how BAD jarred gefilte fish tasted until I went to college and had to eat it straight.  Now I always recook the fish with onion, carrot, celery and the fish gelatin.  This year I will try your method of browning the onion first.  Thanks for posting!"
146637,90086,2004-12-29,5,This was very good. It was the first time I had made/tasted hummus. I don't know how it compares to the kind with tahini in it but my MIL eats hummus and she said this tasted like it was supposed to.
1445414,11217,2012-08-30,5,Amazing Recipe!!!! Deserves More then five stars. After reading all the reviews I also tweaked it to suit my families taste. I chopped the zucchini instead of shredding it and used an assortment of cherry tomatoes from my garden (needed to use them up). I omitted the chili flakes and sugar. I substituted chipoltle chile instead for a smokier taste. It turned out marvelously and I will be making this with the rest of the zucchini and tomato i harvest this year
48692,21239,2007-10-17,4,"Very tasty recipe.  I did add Cheddar cheese (about 1 cup )for extra zest and also more garlic powder and green onions.  The taste reminded me of twice baked potatoes.  I also added about a cup of finely chopped lean ham, which I sauteed prior to adding, which crisped it a little.  A meal in one, with the addition of a side of peas and carrots.  Thanks for posting/"
171290,69227,2004-11-19,4,"This was very tasty. Despite using foil, cooking it in our gas oven caused my fiance and I some difficulties. I'm not sure if the almost burning was because of the our oven or because of the gas oven in general. All in all, it is a very yummy recipe - we added extra cranberries because we love them, which adds a nice zing to the overall taste, as does the mustard. "
189616,105102,2005-05-03,4,"The flavor was very nice, the meat indeed fell right off the bone, but next time i would drain off the excess fat(and I'm not really sure if the 1 Tbsp. H20 was necessary), and broil them, just to make them crispy. Great recipe Dug!"
381180,397854,2011-03-08,5,"VERY GOOD!  I used venison sausage that wasn't spicy at all, so I added two bay leaves, a light sprinkling of garlic powder, and two teaspoons dried chives to the pot ~ I never buy Velveeta cheese, so I substituted 4 ounces grated extra sharp cheddar.  Made for Spring PAC 2011."
875333,49172,2008-09-28,5,"Just awesome! These are the first puffs I have not had to give to the dog. they are easy and amazing!
Thnak you!!!!"
226414,14152,2006-01-03,4,I did this in a low carb wrap that was toasted on a hot gridle and it was outstanding.
422893,167272,2007-03-06,5,"Wow, this was really yummy.
I added capsicum & mushrooms as suggested & served it over risoni pasta. It was lovely & creamy & rich and my hubby was most impressed. This is one to definitely make again!
The only thing I think I would change is to perhaps cut down on the sour cream by just a smidge next time as I would really like the tomato flavour to be a bit more prominent, but otherwise perfect!!"
96896,16064,2003-08-03,4,"Give me a break! I used the margaraine and I thought it was delicious. I don't know about authentic, but it was just wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe. "
34280,48942,2009-11-05,5,"Just tried this -- we added a tad more brown sugar cause we like it sweet, and a bit of hot sauce -- but this is to die for. NEVER would have thought of the syrup but boy this is GREAT!! thanks, Uncle Bill!"
486648,288061,2009-03-19,4,"Yum! I bought some Tzatziki from our local Greek restaurant, and we ate this with that and Greek salad, warm pitas, feta, and kalamata olives. I baked the chicken, and I can't wait until summer so we can grill this, it will be even better grilled! Thanks for a great new (for me) way to fix chicken. It's so quick and easy!"
2000950962,362059,2016-09-22,5,"Really good and so easy to make!! Thanks for an awesome recipe, everyone loved it!"
882556,28148,2011-12-18,5,Yummy sounds heard round the table!  Easy and delish. Thank you Miss Annie!
49747,36486,2002-08-08,5,This was a easy great recipe.  I tried it and it tastes great.
138047,51081,2004-06-20,5,"This was absolutely delicious and one that will be repeated again and again. I followed a slightly different recipe with the beef.  I put 350g beef in the freezer for 20 minutes and then cut it into thin slices. The beef then went into a bowl with 2 tsp soy sauce, 2 tsp rice wine, 2 tsp sesame oil, salt, pepper and 2 tsp cornflour. This was left to marinate for 20 minutes. This was then fried in a hot wok for about 2 minutes. I then added the dressing to the beef and poured the whole lot onto the salad mixture you suggest in step 3 (I used half the quantity as there were only three of us and it was a starter). The whole thing was tossed together and devoured. In fact I wished I'd done the amount suggested because we LOVED it!!!"
1958629,112844,2011-11-10,0,I took the advise of one of the reviewers and added feta cheese.  It was a hit at a recent chili cookoff.  will definately make again as our family transitions to healthier choices.  It was tasty!
58931,55193,2003-12-26,5,"This has become a favorite at our house.  It's quick to put together and tastes great! I use soy cheddar for the cheese - about 3 slices, and it's just enough."
2000631492,123428,2015-11-02,5,"I&#039;ve made an addition of 1/3 C of nutritional yeast which takes this to the next level of deliciousness, great recipe for the colder fall/winter months"
89881,58480,2006-01-13,5,Awesome! I made them for Christmas Dinner as an appetizer and everyone loved them! I used Portabella mushrooms and Turkey bacon and the results were delicious.
2002169589,165254,2018-05-30,5,"Used the broiler of the stove, but seasoned my two 2&quot; ribeyes as instructed. Sauted onions with them, by laying the onions under the steaks as they broiled. They turned out wonderfully."
253932,39269,2007-01-04,5,this is a winner! i nuke it for 13 minutes and don't reheat it since i put it on the blech friday night. the only problem is that the water always overflows out leaving a mess in the microwave but it's a small price to pay.
424680,258512,2008-10-19,5,"Followed your recipe right on down (although I did use 2 very rounded cups of dried cherries!) & you've definitely got A WINNER OF A RECIPE! Great for munching, but also very nice as a topping on puddings, ice cream & hot oatmeal (Am sure I'll find other things, as well!)! Absolutely keeping this recipe around! [Tagged, made & reviewed in the Aus/NZ Recipe Swap #21]"
1043221,137725,2010-04-20,5,Woooooow!  Im definitely doubling the recipe next time :)
332281,20519,2007-10-02,4,"This is the first white cake I have made from scratch. It was really easy to make but it was more of a dense cake than what I was looking for. However, it had a good flavor and I'm sure I will make it again."
265694,23475,2010-03-29,5,"awesome cheesecake...very light...used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese, used skim milk ricotta and light sour cream to cut the calories a little. Also...baked in cupcake pan to have individual portions (portion control is big in this house) so it baked in less time than the hour and a half noted in the recipe. definitely a keeper!"
1802115264,29628,2015-05-13,4,Relly good but a little to much honey for my taste as a chef  and just needed to reduce a little as well. But over all very good. Ty
222055,33323,2006-08-18,5,"This is WONDERFUL! I was looking for a good excuse to have it for myself and was happy when my neighbor came to visit. I made it this evening with coffee leftover from the morning, which I imagine had gotten stronger. It was perfect! Loved the toasted coconut and the beautiful way it garnished the drink. I think it made us a little more than a serving each.  Printing and passing the recipe on to my neighbor right now upon her request!"
934954,67256,2012-08-24,5,"I think this may be the best cake I have ever tasted!  So moist and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, but the cake needed to bake for an extra 7 minutes.  Instead of using a 9 X 13 pan, I made 3 small cakes using bread loaf pans - one for work, one for a friend and one for me.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing."
364326,14701,2007-07-08,4,loved it
1098997,102274,2014-07-07,5,"Pretty good...I cooked mine a little too long so it gt really thick...had to keep thinning it down, but we ate it all!"
52448,31647,2003-05-06,5,Was curious about this dip because it used Cheese Wiz. I used fresh garlic and I added a small tin chopped chilies. All I can say is that we enjoyed it!
125411,99103,2006-03-02,4,"Wow. This was surprisingly simple to prepare and had great flavor. Four of us finished it off...no leftovers! That doesn't happen very often around here. It only took 6-1/2 hours on low, but my crockpot tends to run high for some reason. Very good comfort food....thank you for posting!"
29196,479146,2012-06-15,5,"Yet another yummy, simple recipe Kate! We had this as a side to our roast chicken and it was great. I was able to use our own home grown lettuce and mint, so it was extra good!"
847456,156543,2010-06-07,3,"They did puff, but they didn't puff apart into two layers like I'd hoped.  I think this recipe would make a fabulous pizza dough, but it didn't taste particularly pita-y to me."
114681,178081,2007-06-29,5,"Couldn't be any more moist and lemony.  I used the glaze and glad I did.  Liked it as it was not the usual ""autumn spice variety of bread""  Calee I'll make it again!"
49304,46859,2003-02-15,5,"Oh Sharlene, these steaks are delicious. I made them just like the recipe said. I wouldn't change a thing, Made them for valentine's day dinner. DH loved them.Will be using this recipe often."
1934771,258816,2011-06-18,1,"Needed som ething extra in flavor, I did end up adding some crushed garlic, it helped.  Not as good as the rel thing but close enough since my 2 friends are dairy intolerant."
278493,125363,2006-08-09,5,"My family and I love this pot roast. 

I use Kalamata black olives."
873211,18648,2008-06-25,0,"This recipe was great.  I usually ruin chicken in the crockpot by overcooking it.  With this one, I cooked it on high for 2 hours, low for 1 hour, then put it on keep warm.  Also, at the end, I removed the chicken from the crockpot, made a cornstarch paste and whisked it into the sauce.  This made the sauce more of a glaze.  It was delicious!!!"
1889609,218686,2011-04-20,0,"Haven't tried these yet, but plan on it over the next couple days. To have the eggs peel easy, put them in a pot with cold water, bring to a boil. After the water begins to boil, turn off and leave in the pan for 12 mintues. Drain water and crack eggs, put in ice cold water to cool for 15 minutes and the peel should come off."

381180,327887,2013-06-02,5,"Zesty, creamy, and delicious!  I only had one large lemon and it yielded about 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest, so I also added the juice of half the lemon to the shrimp marinade, along with the garlic, and about 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes.  I garnished the grits with garlic chives ~ Made for Spring Photo Tag 2013."
244971,60560,2005-09-22,5,Oh My!!! I dislike potato salad; but this is FANTASTIC! The chipolte pepper makes this dish

171084,2462,2007-08-20,5,"This is cooking 101...very basic and simple.  This is one of the first things I learned to fix growing up.  We didn't chop or cube the onions & potatoes, everything was sliced.  Awesome with Fried Pork Chops or Cutlets and Cream Pan Gravy.  YUMMMM!!"
1246167,174650,2009-05-14,5,"This was a very quick and easy recipe. The meatballs came out great and my family didn't even notice the difference, I normally use ground beef, they ate them all up. Next time I am going to make a double batch!!!"
371738,95569,2011-02-26,5,Wow!  This smelled fab and tasted great.  Done in my crock in 4 hours.  Thank you.
450518,118977,2008-01-07,5,"This was fantastic!! So easy to make, can use as a side dish, appetizer, or main meal."
31420,312088,2010-03-20,5,"So easy and so delicious!  I don't know why I ever bothered with graham cracker crumbs.  I used brown rice syrup instead of sugar and halved the butter since my flour tends to be moist due to the humidity plus there was the extra moisture from the syrup.  It was still more  moist than you say, but it worked fine.  I would note that you should probably poke holes in it so it bakes evenly.  It was so easy, I'll be using it to make my kids graham crackers from now on.  Thanks!"
174102,327458,2009-08-13,5,"These are amazing and incredible easy (when following the pics).  For those converting to US units, I found that using 1 TBS of yeast worked well, and they turned out amazingly fluffy.  I make these randomly for friends and neighbors and everyone is surprised they didn't come from a bakery.  I lived in France for awhile and these bring me right back.  Great to dunk into a fresh cup of coffee!"
280271,466423,2016-05-23,5,This has to be one of my most favorite salads...it is so refreshing and easy to prepare...loved it! Made for &quot;1st Time&quot; tag game...
1105991,287976,2009-07-19,5,We really enjoyed this!  I made it exactly as written and it was just perfect.  It tasted very much like a dish you'd get at an upscale oriental restaurant but much better.  I used filet mignon instead of sirloin because that's what I had on hand.  I also served it over buttered spaghetti because my little girl is not too crazy about rice.  I wil  definately be making this again.  Thanks Loof.  Made for 123 tag.
2002107964,23225,2018-04-11,0,I halved the receipe. Turned out good. For the first time any batter didn't stick to my cheapo waffle iron.
2000046368,135902,2015-03-06,0,It&#039;s a shame that the photo displays such pale custard pies. It does do them any justice.
30896,374986,2009-06-29,4,"This is a great recipe!  Very affordable and easy to do.  This was the first ground chicken burger I served my family, and everyone enjoyed them.  Thanks for posting."
55773,113580,2005-09-26,5,So easy...So good...Smoothe and creamy...I cut the recipe in half and was just right for 1 pie with a pre-made pie crust...Mine came out a real pretty pink color...I used Cherry jello...Will make again trying different flavors...
603750,67197,2011-08-07,5,SO good!! I made these with crock pot french toast casserole. I was going to make just plain sausages but these made the PERFECT accompaniment. Fantastic flavor!
145352,181719,2007-06-19,5,"Yummy!!!! I left out the mushrooms, cuz I don't like them, but other than that I made as stated! Thanks Parsley!"
60989,97754,2004-11-09,5,"This review is based on taste only because my husband cooked it. Wonderful! The taste of the corn meal really jumps out at you. My son rated it a 5 star, which makes it a winner in my book. I can see assembling this in the morning, and popping it in the oven at the end of a busy day. We did have to use flour tortillas instead of corn, because that is all we had and we topped it with sour cream before eating. I was a bit surprised that it was baked in a 8*8 square pan (as stated) but it says to cut as a pie. Also, this took about 25 minutes to fully warm. Thank you, and we will definitally be making this again.  "
168037,143249,2013-01-20,5,"My 9-year old said, ""Awesome!"" My 7-year old said, ""This is Wonderful; the best food ever!"" My husband said, ""It's a little peculiar but the more I eat it, the more I like it."" I made the recipe exactly, except for using one pound of heart instead of three. Everything else was the same. It was a little salty to me, so I may use less soup mix next time."
38418,107997,2006-03-05,5,Excellent!  And easy!
271347,21768,2008-08-20,2,"I hate to be a party pooper; with all the great reviews, I had high hopes for this but was disappointed.  The rice was dry - that's easy to fix for the next time - but the overall flavor, although different, I thought was ho-hum.  I love balsamic vinegar and was expecting a winner but this didn't deliver. Hubby agreed."
175492,325052,2010-01-03,5,"Made for KK's Top 25 Chefs Picks Event.  As with all of Kitz recipe this is no exception, easy and delicious.

Thank You Kitz for another super wonderful and delicous recipe."
740247,381842,2013-04-16,1,"I&#039;m saddened to only give 1 star.  It sounded &amp; smelled so good while baking.  However, the crust was very doughy, I baked a little longer &amp; it was still doughy but the top was burnt.  Next time, I would bake the crust a little first, then add the meat &amp; cheese &amp; bake a little longer.  &lt;br/&gt;Made for Spring PAC 2013."
1044093,82767,2010-03-01,4,I followed the recipe except for the peppers. I used cayenne instead of habanero. Even though we both liked this recipe I felt that it tasted slightly too orangy for my tastebuds.
383346,353913,2009-03-21,5,"This cake is so good.  Light and fluffy and a great taste.  I used unsweetened applesauce.  Even the frosting is yummy.  Me, my mom, my son loved it.  DH a bit less because of the frosting but he's not the type who likes frosting.  Thanks Ceezie.  This is one of the best cake I made with a cake mix.  Made for Please Review My Recipe."

278639,383739,2016-09-16,5,Delicious! I did not have any mushrooms but it was wonderful even without them!
169430,339194,2010-04-16,5,"DH says ""thank you"" with a big smile! He just loves raisin bread and I don't make it all that often for some reason. Anyway, I found that it needed another 1/4 cup of water in order to knead well in the machine, used Splenda for the sugar, used 60% whole wheat flour, doubled the raisins and skipped the nuts. The loaf was baked in the oven (after using the dough cycle on the machine) @350 for 35 mins.  The result was a lovely, very well risen, light, moist and tender bread..........and one very happy hubby. Thanks JB :D"

1803563469,514831,2014-12-26,5,Great recipe! I saw this in delicious magazine but it had disappeared when I went back to get the recipe. So thank you very much for putting it here. It turned out great and my vegetarians at Christmas loved it.
2002273154,226621,2018-09-12,4,Basically a very good and easy recipe -- quick and tasty!
335614,310025,2008-09-21,5,"I had to make a small substitution on this one. I couldn't get my hands on arbol chiles. The local market had anchos, though, which I love, so I used those. It was still amazing! I love that this salsa has plenty of cilantro, and plenty of citrus, which are some of my favorite flavors in a salsa. I also love that it uses canned tomatoes. So much easier than peeling and dicing fresh ones, and the flavor certainly doesn't suffer for it. The absolute best salsa I've made. For PAC Fall 2008."
61796,36847,2009-11-07,5,"I've made this several times, including for a chil cookoff.  It never fails to be a hit.  I omit the water rather than having to cook it off later, and use three cans of beans... red, dark red and white for variety."
2001301289,29199,2016-12-16,0,Where can I find instant vanilla pudding?
2664120,248268,2013-01-29,4,Good base recipe; I've kept the rosemary in the baking dish (stems removed) with chives  or with shallots; also used ground mustard 2 teaspoons.  Both were very good variations.  Nutmeg could enhance the flavor too--fresh only and maybe 1 tsp.--next to try.
213139,336894,2009-03-23,5,Made for I Recommend Tag.  What a wonderful dish.  It was super easy and tasted fantastic.  The only thing that I would do different next time was to double the sauce recipe as we like a lot of sauce with these kinds of dishes to soak up in to the rice.  Thanks for posting this Queen Dana!
134190,36947,2004-05-12,5,This has got to be the easiest cake ever!! Smells wonderful cooking and tastes just as wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe.
860205,37548,2009-01-30,5,"I've never made cheesecake before and not only was I able to follow this recipe but the first time I made it, it was perfect. It tastes smooth and has a good combination of spice and pumpkin flavor. I have made it many times since with many compliments. Thanks for a great recipe."
998171,71373,2009-02-24,5,"Amazing bread! Has a nice sweet taste, My hubby LOVES this bread. I've tried so many bread recipes and this is the one I always go to when I want some bread I know is going to be GREAT!"
452940,295376,2008-05-10,5,"Ok kids, Let's play the coolest and yummiest spelling game during snack time! Look at the photo to the left of this recipe. Which spelling is correct? Hurry before our big, yellow, feathered friend arrives with Cookie Monster and eats em up cause they are so good! Use your favorite jam or jelly in lieu of the apple butter. I used my favorite plum jelly!"
28346,65911,2006-05-14,3,Made for Mother's Day dinner.  This was easy to put together and had a decent flavor but was not outstanding for us.  The predominant flavor was from the orange zest.
51579,17293,2003-12-29,5,"""MMMMMMM...this is good!"" were my daughter's (she's 8)comments as we sat down to eat this the other afternoon.  I was looking at the scampi recipes because I had some shrimp and I was really glad I found this one that didn't use white wine...since we don't have wine or other alcohol in the house...I followed the recipe to a ""T"" except I added garlic salt for the salt, a can of diced tomatoes, and a little more parsley.  It was served over spaghetti and my family really enjoyed it!  Leftovers were just as good the day after for lunch!  Thanks for such a delicious, non-white wine recipe!  It's a  keeper!  "
324621,128810,2007-09-30,3,"I'll have to try these again another time and try to rate them higher. My main ""issue"" with these is that the recipe said to bake for 45-50 minutes. I checked on mine after 27 minutes and they were quite brown. Thus they ended up being quite dry whereas I had anticipated them being moist like other reviewers had described. I made these exactly as described using a tropical fruit mix, which was perfect since they came in small bits that worked out very nicely. I omitted the nuts since my kids don't really like nuts in their baked goods. They were okay straight from the oven, but I tossed the leftovers because they were just too dry."
221351,49172,2006-08-25,5,"I totally agree with Kris, this recipe is one that I'll use all the time. It's so exciting thinking about the variaty of goodies that go into this basic versatile recipe, on my list I have fresh/dried herbs, blue cheese as we love it, bacon, garlic powder, sauteed onions.....
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe."
563633,69407,2009-10-25,5,"I tried this recipe because I was interested in trying a chocolate version of one of our favorite treats.  Now my kids are no longer interested in my tried and true banana bread recipe, which may be due to the lack of chocolate... :)  This recipe was a HUGE hit, we have made it twice since and it disappears almost immediately!  Thanks!"
199848,58864,2006-07-24,5,"I LOVE my Brussels sprouts and love to find different ways of making them.  This was fantastic!  I made it just as written, but added just a bit of chopped onions.  Fabulous!  Thanx for sharing.  This is a repeater for sure!"
9443,9281,2004-09-20,5,"This is the fourth time I have made this recipe.  I use jalapeno peppers, (X2) and more bell peppers for the chunky texture. I only make 1/4 of the recipe.  It is very good, as a canned salsa."
241248,141488,2006-03-09,5,"Awesome cookies!  Hubby loved them because they weren't hard like his moms. :)  
Thanks for making me look 'good'!!"
724631,228953,2011-07-30,3,"Delicious fresh-tasting salad!  My rating is based on directions.  Several ingredients are missing quantities, and I would mince the garlic rather than tossing it whole.  I used a 7-oz jar of roasted red peppers (yielded 6 oz. fruit), which I estimated was equivalent to 2.5 large red bell peppers in U.S. sizing, but per Barrinaga's website, their 1/4 K (8 oz) jar has 9-12 fruits, so perhaps I had enough.  I used 3 hard-boiled eggs, and that seemed like the right amount.  Lucky me, I had a ripe home-grown tomato!  Made for Please Review My Recipe."
383346,65410,2008-02-12,3,"I found it a bit too sweet.  If I do it again, I would omit honey.  And reduce a little bit the spices.  I liked the addition of apples and raisins.  Thanks Toni :)  Made for Zaar Star Game."
707786,30084,2007-12-29,5,"I used this recipe at the restaurant I work at. I used it because I had no tahini. It was fantastic!! I added a little chili powder, ground red pepper, and cumin. Everyone loved it! Who needs to bother buying tahini? Now I can make it at home too.
flytyr."
2000965299,141983,2017-03-24,5,this was so good! i've had a lot of trouble finding an alfredo i liked but this one was perfect! trying it with some shrimp next time.
487957,203331,2007-05-18,4,"I 've made this recipe several times and many are surprised it's not the real thing.  I've tried it with canned blueberries, strawbwrries in syrup(I blend it to make strawberry sauce) It's fantastic.  I especially live it because I'm lactose intolerant"
659599,149348,2011-03-17,5,"Extremely delicious!  Although I heavily sprayed two bundt pans, the cake stuck to the pan and I was unable to frost or serve to guests."
430471,236999,2009-12-14,5,"I used lean ground turkey cause it was on sale....
We loved this. Not too sweet and not too sloppy, just right for our tastes. Thanks for posting."
394077,44587,2009-12-04,5,How can something so simple be so DELICIOUS!  I doubled the amount of lemon juice and used minced garlic and used 1 teaspoon dried tarragon because that is all I have.  So good!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.
235355,59363,2008-02-15,5,From now on these are what I am bringing to EVERY party!  These flew off the plate at an  alarming speed!!!  Everyone at the superbowl party gave them two thumbs up.  I had to freeze the extra spread I made so I wouldn't eat it all!  I only used 1/2 cup butter and added parmesan cheese sprinkled on top before I put them in the oven and they were lip smackin' good!!!
868673,62754,2008-11-25,5,I make potato salad just about all year because we love it so much.  This was the tastiest potato salad I have ever had and my DH said I better hang on to this recipe!!!  What a great find this was Linda!
2001178963,85291,2017-01-05,1,"Mine burned in my slowcooker. Also, I found it rather bland. Never again."
178427,14701,2010-03-26,5,"Loved this recipe! I followed it to a tee and it was perfect. The only complaint I got was that there  was not enough. I'm only feeding 3 adults and we gobbled it up and the guys wanted more. Next time I'll have to double it, I guess. Thanks for sharing a great recipe."
377581,66654,2007-11-27,4,"This was very good! Its not as complicated as it looks either. Thanks for sharing this healthy recipe. Yummy, Yummy!"
720912,4049,2009-11-26,5,"I made this as a turkey sidedish, for thanksgiving.  I used canned yams ( drained, of course) and I threw it all into the kitchenaid. I did reduce the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp.  I poured this into 2 shells and baked . This took a bit longer than directed-about 1 hour total. I sprinkled cinnamon/brown sugar on the top. Everyone raved and devoured this! This is not overly sweet-just right. Thanks Tonkats-I will make again!!"
551470,28815,2007-09-18,5,"Ahh, my favorite Sri Lankan rice dish! Thanks for posting this one!"
23581,16518,2002-06-29,5,These potatoes are so good. I doubled the recipe for our family reunion and everyone thought they were delicious and wanted the recipe.
560491,379394,2009-09-14,5,This is a very good dressing.  I liked that it had a little bite to it but was not overly tangy and bitter.  I added the optional parmesan cheese (canned kind) but will try next time with freshy grated.  Made for Fall 2009 PAC.
658870,302401,2010-02-10,5,"This is such a great sloppy joe recipe! It's quick, easy and so much better then anything that comes out of a can. I, too, did not make this in the CrockPot; I made this on the stove top and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes. I topped them with colby jack cheese slices on a whole wheat bun and it's been a hit in our house every time I've made these. This is such a keeper!"
376098,269836,2009-09-26,4,"Great recipe, but as soon as I cut into the chicken the breading came right off.  The four stars are for taste and ease of preparation."
1803045764,410505,2016-03-09,0,"Thai is great easy :)
I don&#039;t have soy sauce at home, I used oyster sauce yummmyy"
860538,337123,2013-09-29,5,"This was such a hit at my mother and sister&#039;s combined birthday party!  Everyone loved it!  I substituted Sugar Free Apricot Preserves for the rasberry (all I had), used 1c butter flavored shortening, Splenda Blend in place of regular sugar, and evaporated milk in place of half and half.    I got a few more servings than 12 though...LOL!  Thanks Kit!!"
2001612970,11345,2017-07-04,5,"Love this recipe. I use coconut oil in place of regular oil, don't measure out the salt just do a couple of turns of my pink sea salt grinder, and then refrigerate for a little bit to get the dough firm. Once it is firm, I then can roll and use cutouts. After baking, i decorate the cookies with a powdered sugar frosting. They are fabulous and have them requested for almost all events I go to."
1182984,132353,2010-06-15,5,"I used red raspberries and strawberries. Tasty and easy.   I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter to add richness (I only had skim milk on hand and thought that without whole milk, it might lack flavor). The batter baked up to a wonderful cake-like topping. A keeper!"
1393502,123640,2009-09-23,5,Awesome frosting...I used it to frost brownies and then topped with coconut. Amazing combination of flavors.
136997,1133,2010-08-29,5,"Very much enjoyed. As suggested by other posters, I added some salt and pepper. I too was a bit confused whether to use b-powder or soda. in the end using the baking powder made the most logical sense. :)"
135470,12591,2005-05-16,5,This was simple and straight forward and came out wonderful. My whole family was delighted. Eggs were .69 a dozen so I figured I didn't have much to lose if I messed up! No problem at all except that it was gone before noon the day after I made it. A bonus - I now have frozen egg yolks to make pasta for my son's birhtday.
197201,261937,2009-12-26,5,What a terrific sandwich!  Turkey and cranberry go so well together and this takes the combination to a new level! Thank you!
1206650,371619,2011-02-02,5,I made this last week when I bought about 6 pounds of ribs. I decided to split the ribs evenly and try two recipes. This recipe was one of them and everyone LOVED them. I didn't have pineapple but I used everything else (estimating each time I added the ingredients because I could not see this recipe going wrong). Will definitely make again and perhaps try on the BBQ. I'm also curious to see if the guys like it on chicken breasts.
68960,9397,2004-12-27,5,JanS made this for us while we were in Melbourne and it was a huge hit.  Dave then made it again for our Christmas Day Dinner using the raspberry mix as Jan suggested. Again a huge hit. Very quick and easy to put together with delicious results. Thanks Evie! 
2605027,159277,2013-01-01,5,My 10 year daughter made this recipe almost all by herself and it turned out delicious!!! As good as many bakeries in our area! Only substitution we made was making with 4 lemons instead of 3 lemons and 2 limes ( we had no limes at home). Fabulous recipe!!!!
1064617,69173,2009-05-13,5,"pretty darn good :)

I added onion and paprika."
2359433,33919,2012-09-02,5,This was a hit!
115364,138115,2005-12-23,0,My family didn't care much for this recipe. I think that we just like the natural taste of carrots. We may have liked it better without the chili powder. I am not sure.
103876,21737,2003-12-30,5,This is an awesome recipe.  I made it yesterday and it just keeps getting better.  I used Morningstar Farms veggie meatballs and it turned out perfect.  The parmesan cheese makes it extra special.  This is a definite keeper.
2000498330,177046,2015-11-25,5,"Simple and basic--also delicious. Only addition, coarse black pepper. Comfort food."
242766,138252,2014-08-24,5,"This sauce had the perfect consistency that we love.  I can&#039;t stand thin, runny spaghetti sauce. I didn&#039;t use the ground beef because I made recipe #124958 and used that instead.  I added the meatballs after the sauce had cooked for 1 hour.  I sauteed the onions in some basil infused olive oil before adding the tomato, spices and wine.  I did have to increase the seasonings quite a bit for our taste and I added quite a bit of sugar and salt to cut the tartness of the tomatoes. Thank you for sharing.  **Made for Culinary Quest - Suitcase Gourmets**"
1711014,101041,2010-10-23,5,This is a great Chocolate chip cookie recipe!!! Definately one of my favorites!!!!
242729,283381,2008-08-29,4,"I took Pat's advice and cooked mine in shorter bursts - it was cooked after the fourth short 20 second burst! I left it in the mug to continue cooking and it was ready to eat after about a minute. A great idea - must be wonderful for busy mums before school in the morning! Mine was not as fluffy as I expected either, but is IS difficult to get that light and fluffy texture when you cook in the microwave. A wonderful idea and great recipe nevertheless! No photos sorry, it did not look very attractive - but tasted delicious - great combo of cheese and cooked bacon bits! Made for the Aussie and NZ recipe Swap #19 - thanks for being such a great teammie!! FT:-)"
464080,306762,2008-11-18,5,"This is fabulous! I have been buying 1 new spice each trip to the International Grocery Store, trying to cook ""outside"" of my norm. I last picked up coriander, so thought this recipe was perfect. While I did omit the pepper (don't like hot stuff) and the cilantro (didn't have any on hand, but the flavor would lend itself great to this recipe) it was wonderful. Thanks for sharing!!!  NOTE:  I just made this again with banana-vanilla yogurt and it is a wonderful breakfast treat. . .would be perfect with granola on top too!"
847649,10145,2008-06-06,5,Easy and excellent. I marinated the chicken in the lemon juice for a couple of hours. That was the only change I made. We really enjoy this recipe in our house.
400420,28943,2008-11-27,5,"Several years ago, after many frustrating attempts to make a good pie crust like my mom's, I decided that I would only use store bought crusts.  As my cooking skills have improved, I've decided to give it another try.  This crust was quick to put together and pretty easy to work with.  I've discovered that even if it doesn't roll out perfectly, which for me it never does, it isn't that hard to make it look good in the end.  I agree with other reviewers that it is just a bit dry with 5 tbsps of water, but I didn't add more this time and it worked out fine - just slightly crumbly.  Next time I'll add just a few drops more.  My Thanksgiving pumpkin pie looks beautiful and I used the left over scraps and filling to make some bite sized pies that taste great!  This will definitely be a go-to crust for me!   Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving!"
121690,106949,2005-01-26,5,"I made this with regular small cucumbers--I hope they're not too different from lebanese. This is similar to other yogurt & cucumber dishes I make a lot (I use a coffee filter in a funnel rather than muslin in a sieve to drain the cheese). The novel aspect was the aniseed: I was curious to see how that worked with the other ingredients but it turned out to be very nice. Come summer, I'm sure I'll be coming back to this."
174535,118026,2006-09-11,5,I made these flavorful breasts to go with your Greek orzo salad for our Labor Day picnic and they were well recieved by all. They had a nice spicy bite to them (I added a bit of crushed red pepper as you recommended) but not over-powering. The spice blend was a pleasant mix of flavors also. I actually marinated them overnight which I think helped to make them even more delicious. We really enjoy your recipes so please keep them coming! ugogirl
124190,124611,2007-05-18,5,"Very, very good. I love cumin, and I love zucchini, so well, what's not to love here? I halved the recipe. The kids wouldn't touch it, of course, (EWWWW, what's that green stuff?) but hey, that's their loss. Thanks for a great recipe that will definitely be put on the rotation."
714190,79469,2008-09-29,5,"I made this the other night in a stir fry and it was great.  I didn't use the red pepper flakes, as the kids don't like it spicy.
Thanks!"
887970,25121,2011-07-05,4,"Very Yummy! Didn't give it the full 5 stars as I had to substitute according to what I had on hand: used olive oil, only chicken breasts, and jullienned zucchini in place of the cabbage (but all the rest of ingredients were the same). Also used brown rice vermicelli noodles for which i had to add an extra cup and a half of water (on top of the 2 cups of chick stock) and cook for the last phase with a lid on so all the noodles cooked properly. my son loved it and he usually doesn't eat much dinner so I'll definately be adding this to the repetoire!"
124249,66596,2009-05-29,5,"I really liked this salad.  It was very easy to prepared and the dressing was very good. 
Made as written, 
Thanks Kittencal.

298981,378392,2011-08-25,5,One word!   YUMMY!!!!  This is going to be a regular in my kitchen....thanks for this recipe it is delicious!
186979,417237,2010-03-31,5,"I have a passion for Twice-Baked potatoes but have never made them! I always believed that they were too much fuss to make at home, only ordering them when we went out. But, with this recipe, it took the fear out of failure and they turned out SO good! They were a meal in themselves. Followed the recipe exactly and added some nice crispy bacon to it that was leftover from breakfast. I wanted to add that my kid's had a great time putting this together. They were still talking about this recipe hours after dinner; that's a first! We'll be mkaing these potatoes often! A great recipe, Cupcake Princess! Made for Spring PAC 2010."
2001720552,203785,2017-09-19,1,Mine did not raise. Is there a difference between Bread machine yeast and regular yeast?
1237461,387229,2009-09-20,1,I don't know what if I did something wrong here but I found the batter tastless and it was over all unpleasent.  It was missing something.  Next time I'll use a different pancake batter recepie.
1449216,42722,2009-11-16,5,"This is easy to make and quite tasty. I used a grass-fed chuck roast and it came out great. I also added a little bit of Napa cabbage around 2 hours before the end, which was a nice addition."
344231,417940,2010-04-03,5,AMAZING!!!  What a treat...  the smell of this stuff while it's cooking is enough to drive you mad.  But that does not even come close to the dance your taste-buds do when you put it in your mouth!  I used this a base to make recipe#407989 during PAC 2010.  What a great find here!  Love it and will make it again and again.  I feel honored to have given this lovely recipe it's first review.  PLEASE post more recipes!
328235,2592,2006-09-16,5,"Ty for this awesome recipe. We really enjoyed the meld of flavors. I was a little worried about how time consuming this would really be, but was happily surprised with how easy this was to make. I used canned corn instead of frozen as that is what I had on hand, but other than that made it exactly as written. I will be making this again and again and want to try it with potatoes in it next time. TY for sharing. "
141457,96236,2005-04-04,5,"Loved how simple this was to make.  I hesitated to use green peppers because we are not fans of it, but it just added to the great flavor.  My DD who is not a veggie fan even loved it."
614389,106465,2010-07-25,5,"My Husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.   I used 3 cloves of garlic.  We had never used liquid smoke before wasn't sure how it would taste, but we were pleasantly surprised. All the flavors worked really well together.  Thank you ."
288218,253289,2007-11-23,5,"Yes, it is a bomb! Tasty and strong perfect for a cold Friday night! I also didn't have any grenadine but next time I'll manage to buy to get a pretty colour, too! Thanks AmandaInOz!"
984297,95902,2009-03-10,5,"These were sooooo YUM!!  I altered the recipe quite a bit I guess, but they were great!  I added 3 tablespoons of garlic powder, 2 tablespoons of parsley, about 3/4 teaspoons of paprika; I used almost double the cheese, mushroom soup instead of celery, and because I was so excited, I didn't thaw my potatoes, so they had to cook a LOT longer (two plus hours).  I'm sure the recipe is perfect as is, but I can't help myself and I add other things.  Anyway, like I said, YUM!  We took out the whole batch in less than 24 hours."
1052873,484384,2017-08-27,5,"Very tasty. Good way to use tomatoes and corn which are abundant now. My broiler conked out, but I grilled them on the gas burner. Next time I'll use less onion."
37449,413656,2010-03-06,4,This was so easy to make and very tasty! I served  with baby carrots and quartered the recipe just for me. Good luck!
576767,103467,2007-10-13,5,"Oh yummmmm!  This was just what I was looking for.  Today is rainy and overcast and I wanted to find a warm, make the house smell great drink.  This is it!  My daughter came home from college for a visit and said the house smelled great.  This is so easy and tastes good.  I added some white cranberry juice just because I had some left, and a little more brown sugar we like things very sweet.  Thank you very much for this recipe."
237783,63732,2009-08-10,5,"I truly loved these, since they weren't sticky sweet as most other baklavas I've made, Since they are time-consuming, when I want to serve them, I make them ahead of time and freeze.  The only change I made was to change syrup somewhat by using 1T orange juice and 1T lemon juice. I'll be making these smokin' ""cigars"" for every Greek Night we have! Thanks so much!"
578177,51501,2010-01-12,5,"Another five star review!  I loved telling my mustard and horseradish hating family the secret... after the raved about the pot roast!  ""HORSERADISH?!?!?""  :)  The flavor was very mellow and almost sweet."
461834,304993,2011-02-15,5,"Oh so yummy!!!  I made this for 1-2 serving, using two 6 inch flour tortillas, the cheeses and scallion, but did half of a previously prepared ""Mexican Marinated Chicken Breast"".  This made a great lunch, served it with some sour cream and salsa and, for me, it served two!!  I also did do the grill method.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for Holiday Tag."
522505,33159,2007-10-08,3,"I think I did something wrong, although its hard to see where I did, but I did not care for this dish. It certainly sounded good, but something was off. I will try again though, hopefully it comes out better."
1682950,63828,2010-09-12,5,"Okay, I have never been able to cook a pork tenderloin that was moist.  Whenever I tried to make it, my kids would all cringe.  So I decided to give this one a try since the reviews were so good, well I am so glad I did!  My pork was a complete success!  It was juicy, moist and delicious, my kids could not get enough!  Plus, once you make it, the recipe sticks in your head because it is so easy.  Whoever figured this out is my hero, I will never have dry pork again!  Thanks for the help :)"
51011,22684,2003-10-01,5,"Oh these were such good carrots!!! I served them with pot roast and a salad.  I made no changes, but wish that the sauce was thicker, so next time I may add more cornstarch.  We will have these again soon! Thanks for sharing."
906665,103679,2013-01-15,4,A great soup. I made a few changes- omitted the bacon and carrots and used creamed corn instead of regular corn. The soup was quite thick so I had to add a bit more milk. This was a great way to use up some leftover ham!
230557,29213,2006-12-22,4,"These were fun to make and looked great on the holiday trays.  They ended up a litle too sticky, I probably should have boiled longer than the 5 min.  Thanks!"
1317616,178886,2010-09-09,4,I used this as a inspiration and base recipe with several changes and additions....Thanks for the great starting point! Yummy soup!
22655,28201,2006-11-19,3,I thought these were okay. They are not the same as school's. These are very dry and not really p-nutty. I am not sure if I will be able to get them out of the pan. I am afraid they are going to fall apart. I did sprinkle semi-sweet chips on top and allowed to melt. I will keep searching.
870928,43057,2009-07-14,5,Very delicious chicken--very moist. I loved the sauce and next time will make rice to serve with it.  Also easy to prepare.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!
1801146346,109884,2014-02-10,5,"I made this for my husband&#039;s birthday (2/08/14).  He is not a cake person, so I made this instead.  Except for using 1 tsp. cinnamon, and fresh blueberries (dusted with a little flour), I followed the recipe to a tee.  This is by far the best banana bread we have ever had!  I was going to give one of the loaves to a neighbor, but we finished almost the whole loaf the first night between the 2 of us, and my husband said, &quot;What..........you&#039;re not giving that away!&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Coming from him, that says it all!!  Thank you Wildflour for this recipe!  Amazing!!!!!!!!!!"
690623,393867,2014-02-07,4,This was absolutely delicious!  I did tinker a bit though due to personal preferences and gluttony in terms of sauce.  Prior to pan frying (almost dry) I seasoned the chops with salt and pepper as we have no sodium issues.  We are also somewhat piggy about sauces so I knew I&#039;d have to make more.  I used 2 decent sized rib chops but the whole sauce recipe to which I added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I was possibly liberal with the cream and sherry too. :)  My chives are buried under a foot of snow so I had to sub green (Spring) onions.  I will definitely make this again and again and think it would be a wonderful sauce on Pork Tenderloin too.  Thanks to both you and you sister!
33244,21239,2003-05-03,5,I got rave reviews when I made this for Easter dinner!  I omitted the onions and added 1 cup of cheddar cheese and it was perfect...thanks
19043,11277,2001-10-01,5,"This was really very good.  I liked the creamed corn.  I added some red peppers as well, it was a pretty dish."
164276,23624,2007-05-01,4,"Oh, the things you can do with tofu!!! The tofu looked just like ricotta chesse. I used a large jar of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce. I added all the seasoning to the sauce and it worked out great. I had too many noodles so mine was a little on the dry side-- but that was my mistake."
292000,12836,2007-12-22,5,"This is an awesome recipe. I've made it three times now. Be warned it can be very labor intensive, but it's really worth it. The first time, I think it took me about 3-4 hours. The last time I got down to 2 hours. The changes I made: 1. The meat needed alot more salt than the recipe calls for, so I added to taste. 2. I increased the habanero for extra spicyness. 3. I added 4 or 5 cloves of garlic to the meat. 4. I eliminated the thyme, due to personal taste preference. The texture of the dough was wonderful and perfectly complimented the filling. I would suggest splitting the dough into equal parts of 7-8 dough balls. It's very easy to get the exact dough necessary that way, basically this gets you restaurant-sized patties. I made the mistake of filling the patties up too much, I would say use about 1/4 cup of filling. My family are huge fans of jamaican foods and they gobbled these right up!"
66321,13467,2003-11-04,5,"There's a good reason this has 24 Five Star reviews!! It's easy,quick, and fabulous!! I made the recipe exactly as written, and couldn't be more pleased..thanks for a great dinner!!"
463861,14843,2012-03-12,5,"This was lovely. I made it with fresh onion, garlic etc as I didn't have instant minced garlic on hand.Making more today and freezing it in serving sizes. This is going to mix in well with my weightwatchers programme. Thank you so much for posting your mixes. will try them all."
850821,232058,2008-12-28,5,"This is so fresh and flavorful. I know that you normally use more parsley, but all of the mint makes it super tasty and distinct."
179911,100651,2004-12-11,5,"The most beautiful way to serve chicken that I have ever seen.  The flavors in this dish are extraordinary, and it's beautiful, too. This makes chicken into an a special-occasion meal.  My most particular foodie friend gave this his highest rating.  I'll make this again and again."
55044,324271,2009-01-06,4,"I made this and thought it was very good, the beets give it an almost meat like appearance, I think a bit more spice wouldn't go astray though.  I think next time I might add some chopped onion and jalapeno pepper to it."
316208,214847,2007-06-27,4,I doubled the recipe and found that there was way too many breadcrumbs. Next time I would probably only use 200g for 8 chops. I didn't use leeks but served the chops with a blob of sour cream on mashed potato with vegies. It was delicious.
285039,253163,2012-05-04,5,"I made this earlier in the week, but with 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and with only 1/3 of the butter.  It was very good even without all the extra richness!"
29196,49051,2003-01-19,4,"Very nice, quick dish. The crumbing method was easy, and the sauce was good. Thanks."
68960,55631,2004-07-05,5,Excellent recipe.  I made exactally as written except didn't have cherry tomatoes so omitted them.  Very tasty and a definite keeper for us.  Thanks Chia.
1802744163,261379,2014-05-16,5,"I think it&#039;s great! I mean, some of my friends and family think a different kind of nut would be better since they don&#039;t like walnuts, but it&#039;s still a great dessert. I had to do a presentation on Panama for my geography class, and had to bring a food. I made this, and my geography teacher loved it! It was pretty much all he ate out of all the food! :) Thanks!"
342091,18465,2007-01-06,3,"Easy to prepare.  I used frozen chicken tenders.  Instead of rice, I served leftover potatoes.  The apricot/catalina dressing sauce was a bit sweet, so I may add more onion mix the next time..."
56003,144592,2010-04-10,5,"Deeeelicious!  So easy to fix and so good to devour!  I used skinless and boneless breasts.  When I took it out of the oven, the tops were nicely browned.  Will fix this recipe frequently.  Thnx for posting your fine recipe, LadyOutlaw.  Made for PAC Spring 2010.

128047,91015,2009-01-01,5,My crab eaters loved this.  I put all of the ingredients except the crab in a mini-crock pot and let it heat until the cheese mixture could be stirred smooh.  Then I added the crab and stirred it in carefully.  If you don't have a crab to clean and add you could use the canned crab from Costco like I did.  (I used about 8 oz. and it was plenty.)
166019,27520,2010-03-15,5,"This is such gr8 confort food, my husband loved it.. I did not have stewed tomatoes so I used petite diced tomatoes and I also used ground deer instead. Thanks for posting such a fabuoous recipe... So simple yet so good!!"
130819,285103,2008-06-18,5,Excellent soup - made for a wonderful supper soup. Made as posted with great results. Served with crusty rolls. Have added this to my soup collection. I love 'Southwestern' soups! Thank you for sharing.
740430,69214,2008-07-16,5,WOW!  This was a spectacular burger.  I sauted fresh mushrooms with some onion instead of using canned.  These were a big hit.  DD who says she doesn't like burgers asked for them again the next night!  Thanks for a great recipe!
126440,36634,2011-06-10,5,"I made half a recipe and We loved it.  I did add lightly sauteed red onion, yellow peppers and shrimp the last four min.  Will use chicken breast for me next time but DH loved the thighs."
621626,355413,2009-07-15,5,Absolutely Delicious! I didn't have a lot of time before dinner so I cooked it on high for 2 hours. Made for 123 HITS
67656,339759,2008-12-19,0,"I tried this using a home made sugar cookie dough and homemade plum preserves.  Despite great beginnings, I was    had some trouble with the final results as the dough beneath the preserves didn't quite set up and was unpleasant in taste and texture.  Not really quite sure what happened as I love pocket or filled cookies and have had no trouble before.  Wondering if the dough I chose as basic sugar cookie was perhaps too delicate for the jam, and that the results using commercial dough in the end would have been superior.  The cookies were very pretty and I did use the small 6-point star from my Linzer cookie cutter."
109041,135392,2011-07-14,5,This is a great recipe!  I did make some slight modifications. I substituted low sodium chicken broth for the water and added some shredded cheddar to the polenta (this was good enough to eat by itself!).  I also used dry sherry instead instead of wine with the mushrooms and added a splash of worcestershire sauce because I feel it just goes so well with mushrooms.  This resulted in an excellent side dish that paired very nicely with the bourbon marinated turkey tips that I grilled up.  Thanks for sharing!
50969,49765,2009-07-18,4,"I made this recipe on 7/17/09 to go with mine and SO's dinner. I made this as written. And as for the shape, I just made them into a dozen rolls. But, I do think if this recipe is made again I will make the rolls some what smaller. Maybe small enough to get 15 or 16, that way I can can enjoy more than just one. Thank you for posting and, "" Keep Smiling :) """
2001206360,14756,2017-10-10,0,Could I use Maple syrup instead of corn syrup?
2334843,150355,2012-07-30,0,"Have not had these yet but someone that has, told me to melt just a little butter in the bottom of the pan to make the biscuit bottoms crunchy, makes for a great biscuit:)"
107583,108019,2010-01-12,4,"Very rich and decadent. I may cut the amount of sugar in half next time, thoough. I think this would be good made with cold milk and put into the blender for a summer frappe drink. Made for Winter 2010 Comfort Cafe Recipe of the Day."
201581,54315,2007-02-13,5,This is so quick and easy. I cut the recipe down to use just 1 package of rolls and I made them with ham and swiss. The butter spread is savory. I will be making these again and trying various meat and cheese combos. Made for Holiday Tag Game. Thanks for posting Juenessa.
360437,59939,2006-12-23,1,"I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out very heavy, not scone like at all. They didn't have much flavor either. I don't know how to fix it - probably will not make these again."
31611,14052,2004-02-21,5,This is a very easy dish to make and it uses ingredients that you would find on hand in most kitchens all the time. I tried adding a little cornstarch as Koku had suggested and think that makes the difference between a sauce that is watery and one that clings to the meat. The flavor is SO good!I'm going to fix the leftovers tonight and I bet it will be even better! Thanks for the great recipe Evangelia.
1290903,90086,2012-03-20,5,"I thought this was the perfect healthy yogurt for our diet. Since we are garlic lovers, I added more to the recipe with a little cayenne pepper.  I'm making my 3rd batch tomorrow! <br/>Thanks Kasha!"
1803430250,339453,2014-11-28,4,First time cooking a turkey in a roastet. Turned out a little dry even when cooked under than what the chart said. But is was very good and had a lot of drippings. Next time we&#039;ll know to cook it in less time.
634575,44587,2008-10-27,5,"This was really good. I froze the leftover butter, and have been using it when I want to make our steaks extra special. I did sub the garlic and onion for shallots."
1851484,159563,2015-02-08,5,"I really enjoyed this spicy chili. It was one of the best tasting chili&#039;s I&#039;ve had in a long time. I didn&#039;t have green bell peppers, so I just added some celery instead, but next time I&#039;ll be sure to make this chili with some bell peppers. I think this chili would also be good as a topping for hot dogs (a.k.a.chili dogs.) Teresa, I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, as that&#039;s how good it is, plus it&#039;s one mighty tasty chili. Awesome chili, thanks for sharing the recipe!"
192264,104150,2008-11-30,5,"My daughter made this for Thanksgiving, and we loved it! She baked 2.5 lbs. sweet potatoes, and only used marshmallows on top. Thanks for such an easy and good recipe."
219318,307532,2008-07-07,5,"Made this exactly as stated for a delicious side dish.  Homegrown tomatoes and cukes are a must here.  Very easy to make, and a fun presentation too.  Made for ZWT4."
2000880745,164741,2016-02-18,5,"wow, this works for perfect rice. The whole process took about the same time as my old rice cooker with the waiting to cool before the lid would come off. First,what the hell is a trivet, ok Google what is a trivet, ok got it, used a right side
up saucer. Now for the bowl, time to look through wifes cooking stuff. Found a nice teflon bowl that would work, it had a lid thingy with another little bowl and large ring around it with holes. Threw that part away, hope she didnt need it , what ever it was. Broke the handles off the bigger bowl and it fit nicely into the pressure cooker on top the saucer. Fired up the works and about 30min later had the best rice my old rice cooker that broke ever cooked. Thank You"
89831,89711,2005-04-01,5,"Great stir fry CL! I made this using green onions in place of scapes, and a seeded halapeno pepper, of coarse I used much more than 2 cloves of garlic, something like 2 tbsps. The sauce was just delicious, I served it with white rice. DH and myself really enjoyed this dish. Thanks for another winner...Kitten:)"
131674,262470,2008-01-10,4,"We loved this.  I wish I had a good piece of fruit to garnish this with.  Very interesting taste, the cinnamon does shine through.  Quick and easy."
158086,274579,2011-10-09,5,This was a big hit at our Euchre Group.  Very easy and tasty.  Made for PAC fall 2011.
226066,239886,2007-07-31,5,These were so easy to prepare and so tasty!!  Thanks Mandy! :)
653438,316024,2011-10-13,4,Made this following the instructions and using Mrs. Dash onion flavor seasoning. I also added some green peppers for some more vegies and color.  It is a tasty dish but I think it is more like a stir-fry (which I still loved) probably due to the way I cooked them and DH saying where are the potatoes.  Definately will make again for me anyway.  Thank you for submitting the recipe.  Made for Fall PAC 2011.
1072593,306780,2012-07-14,5,I went to bed dreaming about last night's pesto feta pita pizza.  Then the city's mosquito truck shattered it.
2641328,80983,2013-01-18,0,OMG! This is so different to the Ras I know! VERY salty and too much heat.  I tipped it out - sorry.
1592049,495577,2013-02-21,5,ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! Amazing Fantastic Flavors...YUM :-)
2001130631,260197,2016-08-16,5,"Love this sauce!!! and easy....my 10 yr old son loves to make it by himself. We sometimes add finely chopped zucchini or carrots (any veggie works) to it for some additional nutrition, as well."
163112,322930,2008-12-31,4,This was too tart for most people.  I would add extra maple syrup.  I love the tarragon & shallot!!  This is a great recipe!  Made for the Veg swap 12/08.
269575,52941,2007-01-29,5,"This is so tasty! Especially the mango raita, it is really quick and easy to prepare. It can be made with other dishes too."
455010,60490,2010-03-14,5,"Very good.  The only difference is that I bought lemon curd, everything else I followed the directions."
183684,19725,2008-08-26,5,YUM!! My hubby and kids both despise ketchup and mustard but everyone loves this dish. Of course they know about the coke but not the condiments :) Thank you so much for the recipe....delicious!!
2491787,102274,2013-02-18,5,"Delicious, inexpensive, and healthy.  One of my new favorite soups.  I have made it on the stove and in the crock pot and I think it comes out better on the stove."
522122,55255,2007-08-15,3,This tasted like banana milk puree. It is easy to make if you have bananas that are already frozen. I made the puree at room temperature and then tried to freeze it. It looked like it does in the picture and needed to be much colder.
1806417,87666,2011-01-25,5,Made this twice for New Years Day - so good I would make at anytime - I buy prmade spaetzels and add them add the very end - very tasty and simple top make.
2000498330,116208,2017-07-04,5,"As promised, this was a scrumptious roast. Lots of delicious gravy to go over rice or potatoes. Nice and tender."
37449,150759,2008-12-29,5,"I enjoyed this for breakfast! Mushrooms, onions, garlic, and an egg on top! Thanks! Made for PRMR."
1803678927,280326,2015-01-19,3,"If you like flubbery chicken fat, this ones for you! The flavor was great, and I will definately use this sauce recipe, but not for chicken. Wings really need to be fried to crisp up the skin....there is no way around it."
145489,189245,2007-02-11,4,"I love dark chocolate with orange flavoring, so really enjoyed this combination.  Do not make these expecting regular chocolate chip cookies!  They are quite yummy and in a category of themselves."
71324,137873,2005-10-31,4,"Bangers and Mash are one of my favourite comfort foods, and I always serve them with fried onions. The flavours of this are great and the addition of garlic is good. I give this 4* instead of 5*, because I find the preparation method unnecessarily complicated. I just make everything at the same time, frying the onion with the bangers, or grilling them whilst frying, as well as making the mash. That way I don't have to reheat anything. This way seemed to take me a little longer than usual. "
292436,95601,2007-04-25,5,"THIS WAS SO, SO, SO, GOOD!!!
I love this recipe! I made this with mashed potatoes and cob corn and it was just a beautiful great tasting meal EVERYONE enjoyed! I'm at day 3 and still eating left overs without complaint ;) -oh yeah, I doubled the recipe- glad i did too! 10 stars, two thumbs up, a total keeper, thanks :o)"
69838,88165,2004-06-09,5,"Fabulous! I was able to find pappadums at the market, so I was able to make this delicious snack!  We thoroughly enjoyed this. The lime juice is a definite must in this recipe!! The amount of red chiles in this recipe is very overwhelming for someone who is still developing a tolerance to spice and hot foods hehe, but this was fabulous! Thank you!"
128447,186029,2008-04-02,5,Used this with recipe #39087.  Fantastic flavor.
619582,28026,2009-04-02,5,"If I could rate it a 10 I would! I'm making some more today for a friend who's down in the dumps. Just for ME, my DD and her! We share with no one else! I keep in the freezer at all times, so it stays snappy like toffee. Not something to bring to a summer party for sure! 
I've used chopped almonds on top, to die for! 
Not good for your body, by any means.
Your mood, AWESOME for you!"
36128,56268,2006-01-11,2,"Oh, Daphne2002, I feel aweful giving this only 2 stars, but it didnt help me at all.  I kept trying some everytime I had coughed, but it didnt do anything.  I ended up making a batch and then downing half of it near the end hoping that maybe it would help, but to no avail.  I was still coughing.  I will try this again, because I want to make sure it wasnt just me, or my bronchitis.....maybe that is the reason it didnt help?  SO sorry."
302486,410814,2010-01-31,0,"This turned out well for me. I am on a quest for a good tasting loaf with good texture. This had good texture but the typical smell like most GF breads (I will experiment with other flours next time)I have been trying. It was not gummy like some recipes. It rose well and baked up nice. I have to make this DF/Egg free also for additional allergies so I am not going to rate this, just comment on my results. Since most techniques are the same in GF baking I just used my Kitchenaid with paddle for 4 minutes after adding all ingredients and went from there. Thanks for posting."
66398,18487,2003-01-08,5,GREAT!!  I used venison tenderloin instead of beef and the bleu cheese conquered the wild game taste well.  The potato idea was excellent - A BIG HIT!  Thanks for sharing.
646486,51351,2008-05-03,5,"I have tried several pulled pork recipes and this one is my favorite.  I've made it several times and this last time, I realized the flavor is much better if I don't trim the fat from the meat (this was probably obvious to everyone else).  Also, this time, I used lemon-lime soda instead of water.  And, because I was out of Ketchup, I used a small can of tomato sauce.  Anyway, I absolutely love this recipe.  It has the right amount of BBQ w/out overpowering the flavor of the meat."
182624,183462,2007-01-04,0,"I can't fairly give stars because I had to make a significant change to the recipe.  I had already begun making it when I realized the apple juice I had was actually apple ""punch"" juice, which basically tasted like fruit punch.  I decided to use it anyway, and while it was pretty good, I believe it altered the flavor too much to give a fair rating.  It was very easy to make, however, and I'm definitely going to make it again using the correct ingredients."
911450,57679,2009-05-05,5,"My husband is a fifth generation Floridian and I have always made his mother's key lime pie recipe - authentic and no cream cheese!  But I made this for fun and we call it our ""restaurant recipe"" key lime pie --  it keeps longer than the authentic recipe - retains its shape a little bit better - and the taste is excellent.  Don't tell Mom but I think I prefer this one!"
58104,135927,2005-10-01,5,I just love barley! this is a very simple quick soup! I skipped the sour cream and used dried dill! 
329769,296092,2008-10-12,4,*Reviewed during PAC October 08* A good side dish for dinner or could easily be a light lunch with some salad on the side. This was one of those dishes that uses pantry and fridge staples. The recipe directions assume basic cooking skills to make a white sauce and I added the cheese to the top of the dish only.
1604482,186379,2010-11-14,4,"Made this pie after having a serious craving for Good N' Plenty's Shoo Fly Pie! I live in NY so just making my way over to Lancaster wasn't the most feasible idea. <br/><br/>This pie tastes almost exactly like the pie I remember!! Even served it with ice cream, made it so much better.<br/><br/>The only difference was that I used 1tsp of Vanilla extract, since I kept reading that this pie was too bitter or had a funny taste. The only way I would change this pie in the future would be to  maybe bake it with a different crust, something like graham or maybe even chocolate."
356062,256223,2008-05-03,5,"What a tasty way to serve fish. The lemon butter sauce was TOO good! The mixture of all of the spices was just devine. I went a little heavy handed on the spices for the fish, and added a bit of the leftover spice blend to the sauce. This is a great recipe!"
2000316978,78747,2016-04-24,5,"We just returned from Costa Rica and my husband loved this dish.  I&#039;ll start by saying the flavor profile was great, but my rice turned out a little gummy...operator error.  I sauted a little onion, red pepper, jalape&ntilde;o, and garlic in a small amount of oil.  Then added my spices and worcestershire.  I made a mistake and added by rice and chicken broth to this mix to cook.  The recipe calls for cooked rice and this would have helped it stay fluffy, not gummy.  The flavor was awesome, but the texture was not the same as in CR.  Would definitely make again."
2476717,30165,2013-09-23,5,"This recipe is sooo versatile, I make them differently every time and they&#039;re always great, You can buy a bag of chopped and frozen onion/pepper medley super cheap at grocery store that goes well, sometimes I put the left overs from chicken fajita night in it, sometimes bacon, left over veggies like spinach, hashbrowns, to me, this is the breakfast version of my great grannies &#039;pot pie&#039; which always included any left overs lol! I use about 1 egg per burrito sometimes less according to the volume of other ingredients. If you put a couple in fridge before going to bed it makes it much easier to reheat in microwave and heats more evenly than from frozen. Making so many takes a while, at minimum an hour but if you consider the collective time you save its worth it. My bf and I eat these all the time, they&#039;re so good and easy even for lunch or dinner if we&#039;re being lazy  :)"
2758015,78476,2013-03-28,5,Followed the instructions to the T and it came out soft on the inside and nice and crusty on the outside. I used the dry buttermilk you mix with water. I can&#039;t keep up with this brew as my family tears into it so quickly. I find this to be a keeper for sandwiches
346327,178827,2009-08-19,5,I just realized I never reviewed these. I tried them for the first time about a year ago and it is now the only recipe for pinto beans I use. I love it!
2002203546,125515,2018-07-01,3,"It came out a bit soupy even with adding an additional tablespoon of cornstarch. It was good and I would make it again however, next time I would leave out the cinnamon, to me the cinnamon did not go with the rest of the flavors. I think without the cinnamon this would be great."
65631,59173,2003-09-02,4,"My husband and I really like this.
It's a great side dish. I served it with a rather spicy meat, and a red wine,
this compliments well, because it is a mild flavor. "
315084,230254,2009-12-11,5,This is a wonderful  healthy pizza.  We used flat out bread pitas for the base and even though we forgot to cook it for 7 minutes before loading it up with goodies it still came out very nice though it could have been a bit crispier but totally our fault on that one :) Thanks for posting this tasty treat and it is now in our keeper file and will be made regurally.  YUMMMMM
21487,17620,2002-03-26,5,"Sara..this was a wonderful treat on a very warm Texas day while working in the yard. It's so simple and was quite tasty, I did indeed add more ice cream and I also added a tablespoon of vanilla malt. I think the mix of the mandarin oranges and OJ concentrate make this unique. We'll certainly have it again in the summer!"
107135,214861,2012-02-25,5,"wow these were good and easy , layered them as recipe says . broke eggs on top and baked them for 10 minutes a im not frying my food as much great recipe"
165707,23657,2005-07-25,5,"This bread is excellent. I used one half for panini sandwiches.  The next day I topped it with mozzarella and heated it. I then cut it into sticks about 1"" thick for our teenage sons.  They dipped it into a cupfull of spaghetti sauce.  Our eldest said ""Mom, You have to make this the next time a bunch of my friends come over"""
101695,49448,2004-06-28,5,YUM!!!! wow at first when i was mixing it i wasnt sure if it would work but wow! I cut the recipe in half just so i could try it and i used around 4 tablespoons pinapple for that much! it was awesome i highly recomend it!
133865,75775,2009-08-22,5,We like these thanks
1287956,56363,2010-01-02,5,"It took someone over six years to try this, and now that I have, it will be made again.  Even with the amount of cabbage used, there was nothing left."
1347443,40395,2014-09-16,0,"I have made similar biscotti recipes many, many times in a standard oven.  One very important suggestion that I may offer is this:  AFTER PREPARING THE DOUGH, PLACE IT ON THE BAKING SHEETS, LINED WITH PARCHMENT PAPER, AND REFRIGERATE FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 (ONE)  HOUR.  Immediately after that, bake for about 25 minutes; remove from oven and let cool for to minutes.   Then slice and place sideways as you  return the biscotti to   the oven to bake for approx. 10 minutes on one side; remove and turnover to the other side and bake 10 minutes.  This technique will:  a) discourage excessive spreading of dough  b) prevent dough from being underdone or too soft.    Also, the parchment paper helps in preventing burning on the bottoms of biscotti.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have fine tuned this technique with consistent success.  Good luck and enjoy!"
300920,33489,2007-02-04,5,"This is GREAT coleslaw~ I actually prefer it to KFC's because it's much fresher. I'll be making this often, but with a little less sugar and low-fat milk, just to keep it more guilt-free. Thanks for sharing~!"
11297,276998,2008-05-22,4,This made for a very quick and easy week night meal.  We served ours warm as it was a cold night and everything was ready to combine at the same time.  Next time for a cold salad I will add some cherry tomatoes for added colour.  Thanks for a 'keeper' in my book :)
2000029948,424933,2015-02-27,1,"Try this recipe if you want your fish to have no taste! Very easy to make, but they forgot the flavor!!!!"
873562,181318,2008-10-04,4,Good recipe. Next time I think I'll add some other spices though. It was a little bland for my tastes.
1690437,137530,2010-09-23,5,"This recipe was delicious. Because I enjoy heartier, rich foods (and wanted to add some extra nutrients to it) I changed it up a little bit :) <br/>So... Instead of chicken breast, I used ~ 3lbs of chicken legs and thighs (bone in- but the meat falls right off the bone and you can fish the bones out). I added 2 zucchinis cut into thick strips, 2 carrots cut width-wise, additional 1/3-1/2 cup chicken stock, 2 oz more dried apricots, one potato cut in medium chunks (next time I may use a yam), and about 1/3 tsp more of each spice (if you dont want it too spicy, leave out the additional cayenne pepper). I adjusted the cooking time too. Cooked on high for 3 hours, then on low for 4 hours. I wanted the meat to be super tender and melt in your mouth, and the cooking time on the recipe just didnt do that. I served it over rice, and it was fabulous! If you want, you could add a creamy dollop of spiced sour cream :)"
1213781,190382,2009-10-21,5,WOW!!!!!! This was AMAZING. I saw the list of ingredients and thought this looked too easy to be as good as all the reviews said. It literally took me about 10 minutes to throw everything into a pot (I didn't have enough time to use a crockpot) and I think shredding the rotisserie chicken took the longest time. I used a little under half a roasted chicken and upped the garlic to about 7 cloves. I let it simmer on the stove for about 2 hours and served it with shredded cheese and sour cream for garnish. YUM! My husband said this one's going into regular rotation :) Tastes very complex but so easy to make! Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe!
917666,294481,2009-05-06,5,"Great recipe!  I made it as written and it was really good.  This was my first time making french toast and I couldn't have had better results.  Thank you, iewe!"
9670,72540,2005-05-18,5,"Fabulous! I used frozen frenched green beans and it worked perfectly.
Thanks Bergy for another winner!"
945248,10744,2008-09-28,5,I added frozen peas and sauteed mushrooms to ours and it was awesome!  Left out the celery.  Our new favorite!
1762248,371704,2012-11-18,2,"One cup of Parmesan would have been enough, because both the Parmesan and the butter together made it too salty..  My family didn't rave about it, but it was just okay.  I'd maybe make it again on a weekday when I'm pressed for time."
793153,29598,2008-04-13,5,"We really loved this marinade.  I used what I had--rice vinegar, bottled lime and lemon juice and this mustard called ""bone sucking"" mustard (it is a spicy mustard with jalapenos in it).  I marinated for about 3 hours.  The result was delicious, juicy and tender chicken.  Thanks!"
373006,125950,2006-12-23,5,"I tried this once last year, loved it. Ive been craving it all year and just had to make it again and again it was awesome."
7173268,32844,2018-11-29,5,SO EASY! Great warm comfort food on a cold winter night. I used salsicca for my husband's and vegetarian field roast sausage for myself - we both enjoyed it!
212609,478296,2013-01-27,5,"Totally delish combo.<br/>Made exactly as written, and used it slathered on a wrap with crispy coated chicken and salad - and it was FABULOUS!!<br/>This one definitely stays in the collection - thanks breezermom!!<br/>Made for RookieTag."
184123,73973,2005-02-06,5,This was excellent.  Really does have that Wedding Cake Flavor to it.  So simple to make my 7 year old did most of the work. We used vanilla extract instead of the almond though.  This is definately a keeper! 
51224,22176,2009-02-28,3,"Made this last night and took it over to friends.  It was okay, but not exceptional.  I used half Italian sausage and half ground beef, cut the recipe in half and used Rotini (our store didn't have Ziti).  I might make it again, but would definitely use my own spaghetti sauce with mushrooms."
731939,82055,2010-02-14,5,"This recipe is so good, very easy to make, cost effective, and great if you trying to lose weight. I Love it."
206747,194505,2006-11-08,4,"This was very tasty and quick to put in the oven.  We LOVE garlic. so probably had MORE than 1 tsp. garlic.  Sprinkled some Adobo on top --but there were no instructions for when to add the parmesan.  I sprinkled it on top when removed fom oven, since parm. frquently ""crusts"" at high temps. Also, I ""breaded"" with panko crumbs instead of breadcrumbs.  Makes a lighter and fluffier breading. Will do again -- Thanks , Monsters
"
695933,508914,2013-11-05,5,"A easy recipe to do as is and very good, It make me think of a German Dip. The bavarian dip is a delicious dip if I made with liverwurst and sour cream. Flavored with pickle relish, the bavarian dip is mixed together and and can be chilled if desired before serving. This is a German Beer Cheese Dip Maybe I missed it, but should there be beer in the recipe? How else does it become a &quot;hoppy, malty, creamy dip?&quot; 1/4 cup German lager beer, such as Beck&#039;s. Saute the onion for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Then remove from heat and drain. O.K. You got me thinking?? I can play with my food this time! Got to go do the happy food dance!! NOW !!..THANK YOU for the DANCE and as will for the recipe.....Happy Cooking to you ...I now have two or three ways to do this dip....Party Time....Party....Party....PRMR 2013....Grpa"
2000716834,366252,2015-11-27,5,Recipe was spot on. Everyone commented on how moist it was and the glaze was perfect. Would definitely recommend this recipe and will make it again.
381047,109964,2010-10-31,5,"My husband gave this a nine out of ten.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Due to dietary reasons, I did not eat the cheese grits, so had to add more seasoning to the shrimp mixture on my plate, but it was still good."
2001576100,444946,2017-06-09,0,"I was looking for a recipe for using TVP, to make burgers and found this. I didn't have some of the spices etc, so used-cumin, curry, mixed herbs, fresh garlic, fresh onion, and as one person suggested, some smokey BBQ sauce, I also used a small amount of essence of smoke, purchased in the US last year. This has to be the best ever recipe for burgers using TVP, that I have EVER made..........absolutely delicious."
209747,324962,2009-02-10,5,"Very very nice chili with great spice! You really could not tell that it was made with TVP and not meat. I like that fire roasted tomatoes are used here bc that gives it a very authentic, smokiness that pairs well with the cumin. Lime juice is essential here too for a bright touch that adds a zing to the flavor. I did not use the sugar but think it would be great here too. Thanks Mami!"
37636,337941,2009-01-13,4,"Yummy! The flavor of the fresh crab really stands out! These were a little delicate to prepare, since they seemed to want to fall apart before they got cooked, but I did manage to keep them whole. These were served with Recipe #322382 as suggested and they paired wonderfully. Thanks for sharing. Everyone enjoyed! ~Sue"
101732,362714,2009-04-25,5,OMG! I made this and took it out to my mom's and she even had the neighbors coming over to have some. It was wonderful!! I had to use a white cake mix and I added coconut to it. I also toasted the coconut to go on top of the cake. Very good! Thanks so much for posting!!
1052065,312167,2009-03-30,5,"oh my!! The majority of this recipe didn't even make it into the freezer. I decided it was ""diet"" food since the main ingredient was rolled oats I don't feel guilty about eating this one bit. I grated my own fresh coconut so it was super yummy and fresh. This will be made again in my house. Also, I made this for the 2009 Spring PAC. Thanks  Chef Luny!!!"
169430,184658,2007-11-17,5,This is a wonderful after dinner coffee. It's smooth and creamy and a bit exotic. I don't have any way to steam milk so I just warmed some in the micro and added it. I'm sure that guests would adore you if you served this to them. Thanks Char!
672534,110680,2011-08-15,5,"I really intended to take a photo of this, but somehow it all just disappeared before I could get out the camera.  I used home-made meatballs, and added about 1/4 cup of chopped green chiles, just because I wanted to use them up.  These were super easy to make!  However, next time I think I'll saute the onions and garlic first, just to give the sauce a bit more depth and complexity.   I was looking for an alternative to the usual sauce for the meatballs, and this worked out great.  Thanks for also helping me use up my jar of salsa verde - wouldn't want it to get old."
286209,59680,2007-05-31,5,"What a perfect combination!!! Mushrooms, garlic, creme, lemon, etc. this dish is a taste sensation! Couldn't find oyster or fresh shitakes, used portabellos and added a few dried shitakes soaked in water. Worked really well. Yummy!!!"
383346,88735,2011-08-10,4,I marinated boneless skinless chicken breast in this marinade overnight.  I found there was not enough marinade.  The taste was good but we found it a little bland.  Maybe more garlic would be great.  Thanks Paula :)  Made for All you can cook buffet
169430,469188,2012-12-24,5,"I never thought that I'd be giving 5 star's to K.D., lol, but here I am doing just that! Dh is a mac and cheese lover and even likes the stuff made as the box says to do it, I got him with this however, when he ask what was for dinner I just said Kraft Dinner, imagine his surprise when he got this dish that was full of real cheese goodness and flavor. I really enjoyed the creamy and actually cheesy texture and taste. It's still easy to make but tastes 100 times better and is a handy quick fix for rushed (or lazy) days. Great comfort food that really hit the spot with snow flying outside. I now have a good way to use those 2 cases of KD that he brought home because they were on sale. A Win, win, recipe :D"
174722,325674,2011-07-25,4,"Big hit with the family tonight when we wanted a treat! I only used 1 TBS. oil, however...it came out quite good. Topped it with light Cool Whip. Will make it again, I'm sure!"
35106,286973,2008-09-27,2,Not a good idea to melt to melt the filling before spreading it on the dough --- it was hard keeping it in! The dough was ok though.
170003,26730,2006-12-12,4,"I ended up making this twice- the first one over-flowed BIGTIME in my oven!  But one the second try, it was great!  Just a word of advice- keep the batter about 1/2 inch away from the sides of your pizza pan.  (Maybe mine just wasn't a big enough pan)."
480970,37413,2009-02-22,5,"Have to agree with the others... easy, fast and great comfort food.  Hubby packed up leftovers for lunch.  I used 1 1/2 # hamburger and mixed up a little more of the soup mix and gravy, but probably didn't have to.  There was plenty to go around.  Thanks for the recipe."
1439798,147326,2009-11-07,5,I was hoping to recreate my boyfriend's favorite dish from a local Thai restaurant when I happened upon this recipe.  He and I both loved it.  Carrots were a nice addition and I served it over brown rice.  He prefers his food on the mild side but  I topped it with a little Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce for some extra zest.
20480,140250,2007-05-02,5,"I made these and they are really tasty.Similar to my Chocolate chip cookie recipe.These have a bonus;
dates, nuts and raisins.I never would have thought of including these with chocolate chips.
They make you feel like you are eating a healthy cookie; love it.
Thank you for posting."
131021,52230,2009-04-27,4,This was a hit with us. I didn't have any cabbage and I didn't use the noodles but served it over rice. I had a teriyaki turkey tenderloin that I used in place of chicken so I used all the marinade in the dish. We will be making this again.
248263,79746,2006-10-25,5,"I got this out of my cookbook Southern living Reader's Favorite Recipes, and made the other day for the first time.  My mother hates sweet potatoes, but even she ate these.  My picky son went back for seconds!  You don't really taste them in this -- they just add a hint of sweetness to the mix.  The other ingredients jazz it up so this makes kind of gourmet mashed potatoes.  I found that I didn't need to bake it -- an extra step you can omit.  Definitely a keeper that I will be making at the holidays in years to come!"
362202,255226,2008-08-05,4,"I was craving something different for breakfast, and I stumbled across your recipe.  I luckily had a bag of frozen blueberries in my freezer, so I whipped these up in no time.  Unfortunately I did not have any lemon zest or juice, and I felt they lacked *something* without it.  Next time I will definitely make sure to use both the lemon zest in the scone and make the glaze since I think that would give it a nicer flavor.  What I loved about it was how simple it was!  It took ten minutes to prepare, ten minutes to cook, and only five minutes to clean up my mess, so I had five minutes to create a nice breakfast cocktail to enjoy with the scones.  This is a keeper recipe I will definitely make again.  Thank you so much for a great recipe!"
144490,237478,2008-07-11,5,"I knew when I got to my friend's house, that my friend Liz would be the right person to serve this to as she adores ginger. She thought the warmth of the ginger contrasting with the coolness of the mint was really nice. Did use a little less sugar for her. Nicely done recipe. Now off to make her some of the others I had on the tour. Thanks. Made for ZWT4."
63935,191824,2006-11-12,5,"A fantastic recipe that the whole family enjoyed!  I used a pork tenderloin sliced and pounded thin, and I made less marinade than the recipe called for since I didn't have enough Whisky on hand and just made sure to turn the pork a few times while marinating.  It still turned out well and I will be making this again.  Goes well with the authors recipe for saffron leek mashed potatoes!"
222477,217061,2007-08-31,4,Made it! Loved it! Will be makin' it again!
594322,41782,2010-08-09,5,"I made this recipe into 18 muffins and they were so soft, moist and delicious!  They were a great mix between fluffy and dense. I just sprinkled a little bit of sugar on the top before slipping them into the oven to give them that flakey top that I love and baked them for about half the time.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
1706426,437724,2012-08-20,5,"Quite good, thanks, Mia! Made as directed. I gave some to my neighbor, a vegetarian, and she loved it, too! Served over brown rice. For WT8"
2702373,497450,2013-03-15,5,"Quick dish, had it with some bacon, it did me well! Easy to follow directions with only a few ingredients, it tasted great! Nice work!"
368273,104700,2007-12-16,4,"I followed the comments given by other people, after first making the dough as stated, and you definitely need to add the extra 1/4-1/2 cup for flour.  Other than that, I thought that they were great!  I think that they are a very festive and beautiful cookie, tasting delish as well!  Thanks for the great recipe!  Will be making again, since the first batch ""disappeared"" according to my husband!"
1049139,169764,2009-03-24,5,"This was so easy and fast!  I didn't feel like cooking last night, but I already had some rice made, and had some tilapia in the freezer, so I did.   I am so glad!  This goes well with rice or risotto, some steamed asparagus, and a salad.  I loved the flavor of the lemon- nice and light.  Great recipe!!!!  I think I will broil it next time to get it nice and browned.  I like it a little crisp on the top but without over cooking the fish."
839114,96820,2009-01-22,5,"I loved this very simple yet delicious recipe!  Although, I have to say I basically just threw some olive oil, fresh green beans and whole almonds in a saute pan and then threw a splash of soy in at the end and it was perfect! I thought the whole almonds would be cumbersome but it all tasted really good together.  Thanks!"
628036,39087,2008-02-13,3,"This recipe was nice. However, the flavor lacked depth."
249519,222815,2007-05-03,5,"Well, Yum!  Enjoyed by 7 y/o son plus the adults!  Easy and tasty one dish meal for weeknights.  (Well, plus rice.)

Subbed a few ingredients - mostly minor, except at the last minute, my husband asked me to use ground turkey instead.  I will probably do this again, even though I bet it is even tastier with the pork.  I, too, used LOTS more of the aromatics - we like strong flavors.  2x or 3x.  I used rice vinegar instead of the cider, regular soy sauce, and rice wine instead of the sherry, as my sherry is sweet.  Plus, I couldn't find anything labled ""hot bean paste"" at the Asian market, so I got Chili Bean Sauce, and I used almost 2T, which made it a wee bit spicy, but not really hot.

Two notes - I did the green beans in the oven, but they took closer to 25 minutes to dry and shrivel some.  But, they were also browning.  Next time, I will try 425 for a longer period.  Also, I used a full pound or turkey, and for us, it only served 3 adults plus one kid, and a couple of us would have gladly eaten more!  Thanks for a good keeper, Barbry."
716303,90771,2011-01-25,3,"Sorry, my family did not care for this."
918797,102274,2009-04-07,5,Wonderful recipe. I didn't have celery on hand so I upped the carrots a bit. I also added 1 more teaspoon of chili powder for an additional kick and used vegetable broth to make it a vegan recipe. Soooo delicious.
240110,408728,2011-04-10,5,"As always, I am happy with a Cook's Illustrated recipe.  Easy, clear and delicious.  The big difference between this and other Roesti recipes is precooking the potato.  Therefore, you need to make sure you cook the Roesti long enough to cook the shredded potato through.  I cooked this in an oven proof skillet so I could finish it off under high heat in the oven, a broiler would work well too."
1419864,164125,2009-11-04,5,"Delicious, I added some dijon mustard and garlic powder as well as a stick of butter for added flavour but we all thoroughly enjoyed it, I don't usually like mashed potato so kudos for the person who came up with this one!

I also used a hand blender to mash and blend the flavours together!

I'm thinking of making a indian version with some spices..."
2873848,214199,2013-06-23,4,"I grew up eating Pennsylvania potato salad with a sweet and sour dressing very similar to this one except for one thing.... leave out that mustard, it doesnt need it.  Id never put mustard in either salad."
990700,73274,2008-10-15,5,After many failed attempts at other caramel apple recipes I had delicious success with this one.   My apples were fantastic!  Thank you so much for sharing!
260200,25109,2008-08-20,5,I love this dressing. It's light and a nice change to the overly sweet poppy seed dressings out there. The balsamic vinegar with the orange jc is fabulous!
231686,76174,2006-02-11,5,These cookies were the best I've ever made.  Our youth group just ate them up.  I was really surprised at how good they tasted without any chocolate in them! I've already had requests to make them again as soon as possible.  I chopped up some candied apricots and used some very finely chopped walnuts and the taste blended perfectly. Plus being able to mix the dough the night before and just slice and  slide them in the oven made the recipie even more attractive.  I know I'll be making lots more of these.  
142617,135455,2008-02-24,5,"This is a great dish.  To make it seem more of a salad, I mix it with torm Boston lettuce leaves, or baby lettuce leaves."
39301,157732,2006-07-11,4,"This was a very simple and surprisingly hearty meal.  I appreciated that it was mild enough to feed the kids as well.  When I entered the recipe into the WW web site's recipe builder, it came out at 3 points per serving.  Thanks for sharing this one!"
199848,166476,2007-04-25,4,"A very good, colorful, versatile salad.  I used medium salsa and low-fat ranch dressing.  I thought it needed onions, so I added some.  If I had fresh tomatoes (especially homegrowns) I think I'd use them in place of the salsa.  Thanx for a nice salad lunch.  I'll whip this again when I'm in the mood for a quick satisfying salad!"
400708,56969,2013-07-05,5,"These are well named, they are truly &quot;Killer&quot; baked beans.  The only thing I did different was cut the recipe in half as I knew we wouldn&#039;t need that much.  Now I&#039;m sorry I did as the left overs are as good the next day as when first made.  Made for our 4th of July barbeque and this will be one used from now on.  I used grilling beans and they turned out excellent - everyone was asking for the recipe.  Thanks so much for posting."
75160,42768,2015-10-02,4,I had a can of blueberry pie filling on the shelf and this baked while we were eating dinner.  SO loved it!  The recipe never tells you what size pan to use so I guessed 9x9 and it was brown on top after 45 minutes.
857489,80931,2008-12-05,4,"Very good and easy. I added about 4 cloves minced garlic and 2 extra carrots to this.I used canned mushrooms because I didn't have any fresh and I used a white onion instead of the green.I followed the recipe the rest of the way, using the red wine(Burgundy), and added in some worcestershire sauce too.Served over buttered egg noodles and sprinkled with fresh minced parsley and sourdough rolls on the side. My husband liked it very much. Yummy meal on a chilly night. Thank you very much for sharing! I will make this again."
131109,4627,2004-09-02,5,"Mmmmm, wonderful!"
199792,27546,2006-12-23,4,"These are better than the recipe made with oil. I didn't think they were done and then burned them. Be careful. However, the ones that were not burned were very good. I made half the recipe with the rice krispies and half without. My son preferred without.
Thanks for the recipe."
199848,48842,2005-10-04,4,"This was good, quick, and easy.  I cooked my rice with a tbsp or two of butter.  I also mixed in some chopped onion and a little cheddar cheese, too.  The kids really enjoyed it.  I'll make this again, thanx!"
704950,129615,2009-02-09,5,"It does not get any better than a BLT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I used recipe#208501 recipe and it was totally easy to put this together with no mess!!!  I definitely love that you listed Hellmann's mayonnaise as the mayo to use because if you're gonna do it with bacon, do it right and don't use nasty Miracle Whip or some other thing besides real mayonnaise!!!  Thanks, Stacky!!"
126440,83648,2012-12-25,5,Made half a recipe but used two cans of oysters.  YUMMY loved it.
222564,219558,2017-04-21,5,"YUM! I did use 12 anchovies, and it certainly was not too much. Could use this sauce on baked potatoes or other foods, like fish or bland vegetables like beetroot."
305531,450133,2012-05-19,5,What a nice snack. This really hit the spot. Simple and tasty. Thanks Pat for sharing. Made for Went to the Market Tag.
186855,390116,2010-04-08,5,"It's amazing sometimes how just a few simply ingredients can make the world of difference.  This is one of those recipes.  The combination of sugar/horseradish/thyme is such a wonderful blend.  Mareesme, I would never in a million years thought to blend them together.  You can't stop eating these carrots...they are that good. With the exception of using cut carrots, I followed the recipe as written, and will again too. :) Honoured to make this as a ""Thank You"" for voting for Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia in the 2010 Kraft Hockeyville Competition."
283483,27208,2007-01-05,4,A delicious roast. I had to add a little more water like another reviewer mentioned. I also have an oval crockpot. I used half packages of the dressing mixes like other reviewers suggested and it turned out great.
1800177179,126623,2013-11-02,1,"As delicous as this sounds the calorie, fat and sodium counts make this difficult to enjoy."
89831,94840,2006-02-13,5,"This cake is totally wonderful, I used brandy and incresed the orange zest. I actually made this last night so the brandy has time to blend in the cake. thanks Evelyn!...Kitten:)"
2001426243,500210,2017-03-10,0,I don't usually write reviews but this dish most definitely deserves one! Made this for my family and it was AMAZING!! My roast was only 3.44lbs. So I baked it for 2 1/2 hours as directed. And then broiled it on each side for 10 mins. As directed. Just didn't do it the third time. I was scared when the meat thermometer read 190&deg;. But much to my surprise it still cut like butter! It was delish! Our daughter that had already decided that she wasn't having dinner changed her mind as soon as I made plates for my husband and myself. This is definitely going into dinner rotation! Thanks for the recipe!!
595792,35525,2009-08-05,4,My review echos Wildcook's: this recipe is tasty and easy to prepare.  I marinated the meat for more than an hour and also doubled the honey & mustard mix for extra sauce.  I added minced red chillies on top for some zing.  I bought mixed Asian vegetables for the side dish.  Delicious!
444132,379386,2010-06-05,5,"These dampers are absolutely delicous!!  Like some reviewers, I used fresh apricots, which was a lovely addition!  When I was mixing the dough, I decided to throw a few other things in (I love a scone full of fruit and nuts!) - a handful of golden raisins, a handful or two of walnuts, and a handful of cinnamon chips.  I also used recipe #390393 as I discovered I didn't have any self rising flour on hand.  These puffed up so beautifully!  Thanks, Deb, for a real keeper of a recipe!  Made for PRMR Tag."
2855527,305800,2013-06-10,4,Excellent for a good fill up
593927,180571,2010-07-10,4,"This was fine. I'm sure it would be delicious with better watermelon but still I found it a bit odd that's why the drop of one star. I used goat feta which I know may not be what was meant, a really good unrefined extra virgin olive oil, freshly squeezed lemon juice, sea salt and freshly ground black pepper."
1856592,106213,2011-03-17,0,"This is a wonderful cake that is not very sweet, but the frosting really gives it just the sweet touch it needs.  I added about 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice to enhance the lemon flavor."
173579,26093,2005-03-02,5,I started to post this recipe but saw it was already posted.  This is a very quick and easy meal. Very Kid Friendly.
240449,83807,2006-01-07,3,"I am a veggie lover, so I was looking for a new way to use them in my daily diet. I wanted to like them, but they just were not that good. I ate a few and threw the rest in the trash.  I really wanted to like them."
1730101,150863,2010-11-14,5,Wow! I love potatoe soup and this recipe is so delicious. Not to mention extremely easy to make.
115053,157032,2006-06-21,4,"I have made this recipe twice now, and both times it was very good.  Crispy and moist.  I added about 2 Tbs grated parmesan to the breadcrumb mixture.  Yummy!  Definitely will keep this on hand."
797271,31128,2009-01-17,5,Wonderful recipe!  I've made this pie several times and my whole family loves it.  It couldn't be any better.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.
779699,364618,2009-09-20,5,"This dip is simply divine. Do yourself a favor and try it! I halved the recipe, but added extra cheese and I added some shredded parmesan to the mixture and to the top! We enjoyed it for a football spread and had it on slices of french bread, warm from the oven! Thanks for posting this is a no fail pleaser! Made for Newest Zaar Tag!"
2320601,173527,2012-07-07,4,"Good and easy. However, the recipe should be rewritten with the ingredients listed according to when they are used.  This list of ingredients seems somewhat random and made the recipe more difficult to follow than it needed to be."
503676,30380,2009-01-21,4,"Tried it last week and hubby said he liked this way to prepare swordfish. Not so sure if I would mix it with any water next time though, depend on how much water the fish will produce from thawing."
53932,100865,2006-05-14,4,The lemon juice in the sauce makes all the difference!  I only prepared half the sauce and found that to be enough.  I think I would also omit the soy sauce next time and substitute a bit of salt instead as I thought the soy flavor was a little strong (but I really don't like soy sauce all that much anyway).  Thanks for sharing.
47230,35869,2002-08-28,5,"I have heard of this drink, but never had a recipe for one. Thanks to you, now I do. The taste is so wonderful. The way the colors layer is really neat. I like almost any tequila based drink so this was right up my ally. My husband and I had a great evening, if you know what I mean ;)"
1543071,84247,2010-02-05,5,"One of my favorite chicken recipes - this dish gets more delicious every time I make it! It's super easy, so flavorful, and goes great with any side dish!"
296027,310086,2008-07-11,5,"We had Tri-Tip using this marinade along with recipe #313314 for one evening's meal - what a treat!!!  I cannotwait to make this again here at home and enjoy the savoury flavors AGAIN!!!  Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe, V!!"
213139,312728,2009-01-16,3,"Made for I Recommend Recipe Tag.  This was okay.  I felt that it could have used more seasoning, specifically salt.  I will use this again, but will up the spices as it was a little bland for our tastes."
234656,9954,2005-11-26,5,"I've been making our Thansgiving turkey following this recipe exactly for the past 2 years, and it always turns out fantastic.  Normally I'm one to tinker with recipes, but his one really doesn't need it at all.  If you've never brined a turkey before, this is so easy, and produces a fool proof, amazing turkey.  I highly recommend this method to anyone looking to do something different with thier turkey! "
416985,87420,2013-05-28,5,OMG. That&#039;s all I can say. OMG. :)  THANK YOU FOR SHARING~
50313,161360,2014-09-20,5,"So before I made this recipe, I made the jalapeno cilantro cream sauce twice. The first sauce I made as directed and served it with tacos and burritos in place of ordinary sour cream. I let the sauce sit in the fridge for 3 hours to let the flavors blend. While I thought it was good, it wasn&#039;t quite hot enough for our tastes. In fairness we do like VERY spicy food. The second time I made the sauce to top baked potatoes, I made it as directed but left half of the jalapeno&#039;s seeds in hoping for more hot. It was much better but still not hot enough. The third time was when I made the fiesta chicken. This time I made as directed but used 1 jalapeno, 1 habanero, and one half of a hatch green chili (no seeds from any). It was the best sauce so far. For the chicken I made as directed except I just used store bought breadcrumbs. I also used 1/2 tablespoon New Mexico Red chili powder and 1/2 tablespoon McCormick chili powder. The chicken came out awesome and paired so well with the cream sauce. Since this is such a good recipe, I must check out other recipes posted by Susie. Thanks."
13483,19495,2002-08-07,4,"I enjoyed this and found it easy to make but it just did not seem to have the ""umph"" I though it would.  I love balsamic vinegar but it just did not seem to work in this recipe for me!!  Maybe I overcooked it or something??"
298043,36206,2006-07-24,5,"You're right; this is a delicioius winner.  I prepared it precisely as written and wouldn't change a thing!  A simple salad and glass of wine makes this a perfect dinner.  We'll be making this for company next time.  Thanks for posting, Judekins."
12467879,36561,2015-11-12,5,Fantastic!  I had to use chipotle instead of thai peppers.  Delicious!
700966,7690,2008-01-13,3,"Not bad at all! Flavors were good (I needed considerably more salt and pepper) and it was straightforward to cook. The ingredients are also things that most cooks keep on hand. The allspice was a surprise, but worked all right in the dish. The only thing I'd want to work on is the sauce; it was quite thin and watery and the chicken looked anemic after taking all that trouble to brown it. I thickened mine with cornstarch-in-water. Browning flour in the veggies before adding the broth and wine might also have done great here, sort of like how one makes smothered chops. But it was filling and easy to make and I liked the taste. I needed ""something new"" to do with chicken thighs and this is something I will cook again with some tweaking. PS: This is also very low-carb friendly if you just eat it out of a bowl and skip the pasta suggested!"
89831,201870,2007-01-14,5,"This is a great for a crockpot, I made as stated only used smoked beef sausage in place of chicken and browned the sausage first, I added in some Creole seasoning to add some heat and also increased the garlic to 2 tablespoons, I haven't used my crockpot in a while and I think it is about time for a new one as this took 5 hours on HIGH to cook, anyway thanks for sharing Toni!...Kitten:)"
175492,198500,2006-12-06,5,"ohhhh my goodness these are easy and ohhh so delicious. Ate some with the Slata Tunisiya recipe#195472 till I thought my tummy would burst, then had a few cold today for lunch.  Made a second batch and doubled it...putting them aside in freezer for future cooking up whenever I want a delicious snack.  I think these would even make great appetizers, they are just so darned good.  Thank You for a great recipe Melissa."
235496,7883,2010-08-05,5,"Delicious! I had fresh beets in my weekly produce delivery box and wanted to try something new with them. This recipe was it. I roasted the beets in the oven (drizzled with a little honey) and then pureed them in the blender. I also melted chocolate chips (about 1/2 c melted) because I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate. It turned out great - and the kids loved it! They had no idea that beets were the secret ingredient in their ""chocolate"" cake."
2698609,495181,2013-02-17,5,nummy yummy
2001968560,259332,2018-02-02,0,it did not work
391048,92103,2007-02-19,4,I think I'll omit the milk next time and add some jalapenos. I love this side dish!
874900,31235,2009-10-13,5,Love this recipe!  I made half a batch and silly me added 2 tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice.  That is way too much even though the spice is lovely.  I think 1/2 a teaspoon would be better next time.  So I made another half a batch of this recipe as written.  Then just before I am about to eat it I mix in a little of the pumpkin pie batch to the regular batch in my bowl.  Thank goodness I can still eat it even though I screwed it up.  Looking forward to making more with a different combination of things as other reviews recommend.
2381183,57177,2012-08-29,5,Very nice!
26535,66857,2010-02-26,5,"WOW!  this is REALLY good and VERY HOT!!  that's probably my own doing tho...regardless, my boyfriend and i loved it.  i doubled all the spices for 4 chicken breasts so that everything coated thoroughly...however, i did only use 1 tsp of cayenne (which turned out to be a good thing, if you don't like your food really spicy, be sure to cut that down pretty dramatically.) i seared the chicken for probably 2 minutes on each side, put them on a broiler pan then popped them in the oven for 15 minutes to make sure the chicken was cooked all the way through.  it was so moist and delish with this wonderful blackened ""crust"".  i can't wait to make this again with an alfredo sauce.  Thanks Latchy!!  p.s. the other posters are right...this dish creates a LOT of smoke.  i'm glad they mentioned that or i may have freaked out a bit when i was cooking it...but that's totally normal."
369715,223049,2008-04-30,5,"Made for Spring PAC 2008. This was very easy to make as a side dish and everyone enjoyed it. I followed the recipe as written other then I used shredded swiss instead of slices of swiss. I think this would taste great with other kinds of cheese too. Will be making again when I quick, easy, potatoe side dish is needed for dinner."
703739,12208,2007-12-26,5,"Don't overcook.  Also SAVE the broth and the fat-freeze and remove the fat for confit, and use the broth for a very rich base."
531759,12386,2008-09-23,1,If you are looking for simple this will do. If your pantry has a dozen flavors of vinegar you will be disapointed.
1788254,50677,2012-07-16,4,"This recipe was in a 2007 Taste of Homes mag submitted by Kim Osburn, and it is also on all recipes.com since 2007.  I was looking for different versions of this but all the recipes are exactly the same.  LOL :)  It's good but drain the grease off the beef to help keep the bottom layer of chips form getting soggy.  I also add diced onions to the meat."
1164063,153343,2010-04-25,5,"I have made this cake several times and everyone has enjoyed it.  I added the extra 1/2 cup of half and half and extra oreos like the suggestions, and it has turned out wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!"
309508,269681,2008-06-02,5,"Super flavor!  This is a great salad and a wonderful excuse to make a bunch of bacon that accidentally gets eaten by the cook. ;)  Be sure to make a full recipe, I scaled back to serve 4 and it barely hit the table before it was gone!!  Nice work."
124249,147758,2006-12-16,5,"Made these for Thanksgivng and forgot to rate them. My family likes brown and serve rolls and they liked them prepared this way. The spread was a nice addition to the roll. 

Thanks coconutcream.

318235,128494,2007-08-17,5,"You couldn't ask for an easier more delicious pie recipe! I was worried that without the cornstarch it would be a little runny in the middle, but that was not the case at all. Thanks!"
160977,179776,2006-08-05,5,"Hubby asked: ""Is five stars the most you can give?"" This was just great. At first I thought that the flour wouldn't ""melt"" in but when it started boiling it blended just fine. Boiled it for exactly 10 minutes and then it was still runny. Decided NOT to boil it for longer which was a good decision. When it had cooled down it took on the thickness of a spread.
The next day I baked a round plain white cake, let it cool and divided it. Spread about two tablespoons of the lemon spread in between. Heavenly! Divided the rest of the spread in three and froze it. Couple of days later I took out one portion and used it on toast. So happy to have found this. Thanks for sharing."
215350,57130,2008-11-09,5,Can't go wrong with this! Very easy. I added carrots and potatoes to the bottom of the crock pot too. Thanks!
758742,113817,2010-03-03,5,"EASY,EASY,EASY and tastes great too! Cleanup is a breeze.  The only suggestion I can make is to put more spices on the salmon before the asparagus is added."
611005,248253,2010-07-23,5,"Wow! What a great, quick, delicious recipe. I used Splenda instead of sugar. This bread tastes een better the next day. Definitely perfect for freezing and gifting."
2000342260,448863,2015-07-16,5,425 seemed a little high for pork loin so I lowered the temp to 400 when I made mine and it came out great. The only thing I would do next time is flip the loin halfway through to get the bacon crisp on both sides. Great recipe though. The sage is a great addition to an otherwise common recipe. The apple and onion sauce really elevated the dish as it was both savory and sweet and paired perfectly with the pork. I surprised my wife with this for dinner tonight and we both loved it. It tastes like it took all day to make. I will be making this again.
182010,138114,2005-10-18,5,"Took Kumquat's advice and upped the spice a bit and did remove all pith from the oranges.  This was part of an array of Moroccan appetizers and worked wonderfully.  Thanks, Caroline!"
283390,128717,2006-09-24,3,"Not bad!  I wasn't really wild about the way the bitterness of the tea tasted with the vanilla vodka, but the honey did take the edge off a bit. Next time I probably wouldn't steep it as long, and I might add more honey (which is weird, because I don't usually like really sweet drinks). Thanks for sharing...it definitely gave me some cool ideas for a chai beverage of my own!"
145626,93900,2006-10-16,3,I made this last night and I felt like it was too runny.  There is another faux-tatoe recipe that calls for 3oz cream cheese and a little butter and garlic that I prefer over this. BUT it is a sub for mashed potatoes so that makes it good.
526666,116033,2011-07-25,5,"Loved it! Great for a 'kinda' light lunch, and flavors I adore! I used baby swiss and skipped the paprika sprinkling. YUM! I will need to remember this the next time DH says 'grilled cheese?' Made in honor and memory of Pets'R'Us!"
392230,52868,2007-06-27,5,"Oh so yummy! We loved this recipe! Very easy to put together, and so tasty! Thanks for sharing! Made for World Tour."
604167,73831,2007-10-09,5,"Wow! I made this bread and it was beautiful and tasted good. This is going to be my Challah recipe from now and on, the best challah bread I have made!"
1545331,218895,2010-04-18,3,"I cut this recipe in half and replaced the oat bran with wheat germ. While it was cooking it smelled delicious, however, leaving it in for the suggested 20 minutes resulted in a burnt mess. I suggest lowering the temp to 225 and stirring every 5-10 minutes to ensure even cooking and browning."
402559,143254,2007-03-20,5,"Great recipe, I used Starbucks Coffee Liqueur for half the water, YUMMO!"
52448,63364,2003-08-05,5,"Like Rita I also halved the recipe, served it with ice cream and added some Grand Marnier, lovely dessert!"
336058,280440,2009-07-01,4,"I tagged this in V'gan Recipe Swap July 09.  I am also on a restrictive diet and everything but the honey is allowed.  So I subbed 1/4 C veg. glycerin and some stevia for sweetener and used regular milk powder.  Instead of rolling into balls, I just put it in a container that I could scoop a spoonful out of when I wanted a chocolate fix.  It is very sweet this way (don't know if it's the same w/honey?) so I can only have a little at a time.  But it's nice to be able to have a chocolate fix once in awhile."
416985,418082,2010-06-11,5,"This was a great dish!! The natural taste of the basmati rice only needs onions to make it SO TASTY!! We loved this- and what a nice, easy sidedish. Even my DD, who doesn't like onions, liked this. Thanks so much!! ZWT6 and the Xtra Hot Dishes."
64154,178104,2006-09-19,5,"Excellent jerky. Taste is just as descibed. First bite real sweet then the spiciness hits.
I done mine in the smoker for 4 hours at 200 degrees. If doing in the smoker, you may want to hold the temp around 175. Mine turned out tender and moist, but the sugar content of the rub caused the outside of the jerky to blacken. Didn't cause any problem taste wise. 
It is a definite keeper. Thanks for sharing. "
808027,320634,2008-08-21,5,Love it!
202224,84486,2005-07-30,5,Made this yesterday even though I only got a spoonful my DH rated it very high.  The flavor were good mixed together and the chicken was tender.  Can't get any easier than this. Thanks for the recipe.
131126,461052,2011-08-18,5,These were full of flavor & fairly easy to make. I appreciated the flavors in every component and thought all of the parts added up to a nice recipe!   Although I loved the results of the recipe I encountered a few problems in the instructions.  I was undecided as to why there was more rice cooked than utilized and  the missing oven temperature (I used 350 degrees). <br/>I used Recipe #109685 in this recipe and ground turkey.  This did up being one of my families favorite Dining on a Dollar contest recipes.  Good luck in the contest!
169969,282953,2008-02-29,4,"I made this as a side dish and it was easy to make and was a great side dish. The flavors did not dominate our main course at all. Our 6 year old loved it (although he picked out all the sun dried tomatoes) and said it was awesome! I reheated the leftovers the next night and then noticed that the flavors shined. I don't think we would eat this as a main dish, but we certainly enjoyed it as a side. Good Luck Chef!"
593927,255326,2010-01-02,5,5 stars without lemon (I just didn't try with because of another review) It needs to be strained as well and then you can enjoy it much more. I did not use nutmeg because of it's intoxicant properties (religious reason) so I added a less amount in allspice instead. I would make this again the same way. Made for Welcome to the Comfort Cafe - Snow Queens Round 01/10.
449242,81968,2008-09-01,3,Good chickpea recipe.
31232,26958,2003-01-01,5,"Excellent flavour combination.  I think the secret to making the dough easy to work with is to let the filling cool slightly and keep the dough cool by working with it quickly.  I also halved the vegetable amount and made 8 vegetable samosas.  I then, browned a 1/3-1/2 lb. of lean ground beef and used the same spices to make the other eight, meat samosas.  I also used fresh ginger and coriander as I used to make these many times with a good friend of mine.  I remember the fresh ginger taste in hers was wonderful.  The powdered works fine, just my personal preference.  Many thanks for a great recipe.  Now I don't have to wait until I see her for the great taste.  Enjoyed by all the family.   "
1800127378,189133,2013-10-15,5,I&#039;ve tired many tiramisu recipes over the last month and this one is the best. I don&#039;t use the wine because children will be enjoying this. I do not cook the egg. I&#039;ve tried that technique it turns out too runny. I love that this recipe uses the egg whites it adds a nice pluffyness plus I&#039;m not wasting perfectly good egg whites. It took me around one hour to put it together (first time) be carfull you don&#039;t over soak the lady fingers. Also the brand of lady fingers seems to have a different outcome. I am using Savoiardi.
4470,155174,2009-01-25,5,5 STAR FOR SURE I did them a bit different - Instead of adding the parmesan to the mushrooms I sprinkled it on top on the mushroooms on the baguette slices - I didn;t use any butter or oil just 2 sprays of no oil- one on the bread before adding the mushrooms and a quick spray on top of the mushrooms on the baguettes before topping them with the cheese Baked in 375 oven for 14 minutes Perfect!
60496,56254,2007-02-06,5,"I made this last Sunday, for our diner guest. The only thing I changed was that I had to double the recipe. It turned out just great. Easy to make, pleasant to the eye, and it tasted fantastic! I served it with a few bottles of chilled Riesling Wine. The only complaint, there were no left overs :)"
176615,313957,2009-12-17,5,"Quick and easy. Pureed with a hand blender before adding the cream. Only change I'd make would be to use two cans of fire-roasted tomatoes next time to make sure that flavor is pronounced, and add a couple of cloves of garlic after sauteeing the carrot. Thanks for sharing!"
383346,435774,2012-01-23,5,I like orzo and rice dish.  This one was so good.  Easy to do.  I used chicken broth.  Thanks luvcook'n :)  Made for the Best of 2011 tag game
4470,9391,2010-05-23,5,I have made this recipe several times - love it - and I know that I reviewed before but the review is gone  SOoooo once again this is a super recipe! Wonderful to have on hand to serve as a condiment or a side dish.  This time I made it vegetarian by using Vegetable broth instead of Chicken or beef - equally good. I used it on a sausage in a bun for dinner last night and this morning as a side dish for my Sunday Brunch. 8 hours on high gets the onions really golden and ever so good -  I said it before and I say it now Cajun Joe thanks for posting this recipe. 22 May 2010  I keep adding to this review but these onions are so darn good! The 8 hours on high is just perfect timimg Thanks again Cajun Joe
542270,262103,2008-09-14,5,"Awesome easy dish!  I topped it with cheese and it is great!  Definitely a ""make again""!"
653438,262687,2014-01-26,5,My of my!  We had a wonderful salad.  I cut the recipe in half for DH and I and added the garlic to the dressing and put some red onion slivers in the salad but otherwise went on with the recipe.  Delicious!  Served with some warm garlic bread and that was really our lunch.  Definately a keeper and one to make again.  Thank you for posting.  Made for Zurie in memory of her husband.
593927,112961,2011-03-24,4,"This is OK but I don't think I like tuna heated so much to just eat with rice crackers as we did to be gluten free. I used Clover Leaf tuna in water, cayenne pepper powder, to taste instead of the jalapeno pepper, as that is what I had on hand, unrefined extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, and I did add the optional freshly squeezed lemon juice and red Tabasco sauce per our taste."
883837,16115,2008-11-20,5,I can't imagine this without the lemon.  It added so much depth to the dish.  This was a sure-fire winner with my gang and we will definatly make this a repeat dinner very soon!
726142,63460,2008-04-06,4,"What a different spin on breakfast! These were great, but the batter did need a little something. I will experiment with that a bit, might try some sugar or perhaps a little honey. I want to try this with other fruits too and see what happens! I'll add some butter or maybe some whipped cream next time around instead of sugar on top."
53932,117297,2007-02-12,5,"This was a perfect finish for Recipe#103846.  Lots of flavor without being too spicy for wimpy me.  Thanks, Gayla."
219865,162848,2009-03-05,3,"this was alright, we prefer a more saucy pasta though"
485109,254176,2009-12-09,5,"What a wonderful recipe! After a morning of rehearsing the Christmas play with 30 4-5 year-olds, this was exactly what I needed for lunch. I sliced the green onions lengthways and they added the perfect tang to the sandwich. Next time I'll definitely add the avocado! Thanks Andi for a wonderful lunch!"
130663,187764,2006-10-02,4,"Made 1/2 a recipe,it was very good.Served it with a salad.It would be great for a group of people."
39329,113299,2005-09-03,5,I have eaten these at a meeting I attended and they were delicious. I made them when I got home and they were still great. Sooooo easy. After reading some of the reviews I have decided 350 is the best temp for them.
74652,131292,2005-12-06,5,"These were terrific!  I only had frozen strawberries and blueberries but it still turned out great! Healthy and delicious!  This is a keeper and I will defintely use it when I have fresh fruit in the Summer! Thanks
"
1889051,216376,2011-04-20,3,"The taste is great, but the consistency isn't. I bake all the time, and this recipe came out very dense, more like cornbread. I'd suggest using cake flour instead of all purpose flour."
199848,370585,2009-06-07,5,"Wow!  I would've never thought to combine these ingredients, but it works!  A little sweet, fizzy and lemony.  I saved some calories by using diet A&W cream soda and lemonade made with Splenda.  I loved this with the brandy, and I'm sure rum would work well, too.  Thanx for a great (and easy) drink!"
133174,27210,2009-08-26,5,"I can well understand why this recipe has so many wonderful reviews.  The recipe was reduced to 2 servings and the chops were in the marinade all day.  They were tender, flavored and nicely seasoned.  The lemon pepper was reduced considerably.  This is a recipe I will make again."
829250,61402,2014-05-28,3,"These turned out very cake like. I halfed the recipe but added another egg, a little vanilla extract, and a banana. Didn&#039;t really taste the banana and I only used 3/4 cup of sugar, so not too sweet."
37950,169577,2006-05-31,5,"This recipe earns 5 stars from me for ease of preparation and delicious flavor! I have to admit hubby and I were both skeptical that this recipe would be ""incredible,"" but that's exactly what it was. I used about 4 lbs. of cut up chicken pieces and followed the recipe exactly. I did not need to cover my chicken and the brown sugar made such a lovely, sweet, sticky glaze on the chicken. My whole family greatly enjoyed this recipe and we plan to make it again soon. Yum!"
166642,30079,2008-09-12,5,"I love these sandwiches from McDonalds and I love making them at home. I used the Thomas' Light Multi-Grain English muffins, Kraft 2% reduced-fat cheddar cheese and 2 slices of Canadian bacon. I made my egg over-hard. This is so easy and tasty. Made for the September Photo Challenge - Breakfast Anytime."
89831,417149,2010-05-22,5,"this is a delicious dessert, I just used the juice of one whole lemon and that seemed to work fine, this would make a wonderful dessert to serve at dinner party, thanks for sharing Nif, this was made for KK's Strawberry Patch game"
324390,260700,2008-02-25,5,These got rave reviews from kids and adults alike. A sweet indulgence that will make you smile or make them for your friends and family and watch the smile it brings to their faces! I used a cookie scoop to scoop out the dough and a 1/2 tablespoon to scoop up the caramel. I really liked that they were in muffin cups which eliminated the need for messy cutting and made it convenient to travel with. I'm saving this recipe in my favorites! EDIT: I just saw this recipe in the Pilsburry Cook-Off cookbook and noticed that the chocolate chips are not supposed to be visible and the caramel should be about the size of a quarter in the middle of the cup with a few chopped pecans on top. I'm not very good at following directions but They still tasted great.
121985,44919,2004-10-15,5,"This was very creamy.  It was not the texture that i was looking for, but it was good nonetheless.  I made mine with bacon, portabella mushrooms and cheddar cheese.  It turned out very good.  Next time i'll be sure to add more salt and pepper before cooking.  Thanks for sharing this easy to follow recipe.  "
39277,31579,2002-09-12,5,I made this for supper  and we thoroughly enjoyed this. I followed your directions exactly. I sauteed the chicken and vegetables about 8 minutes and the vegetables were moderately soft (how we like them). I just discovered broccoli slaw at our grocery and love it. Worked very well in this recipe. My family and I thought this was a wonderful fajita wrap and we will make it often. Thanks.
80998,284512,2008-12-08,5,"I didn't have any cream, so I used milk and that was fine.  It is a strong drink.  I probaby milked it down more than most, but I found a perfect taste for me.  Thanks Mary!  Made for Bevy Tag 2008."
431813,250783,2007-09-19,5,"This was super tasty.  I didn't get chocolate cake from it, but it was still a tasty shot.  Thanks Cookiedog!"
323328,224062,2010-04-17,5,"Like Yogachef, we got kale in our first CSA box this season. DH doesn't care for most greens, and I was hoping he'd like them okay in this dish.  Okay was an understatement!  He said to give it 5 stars and I have to agree.  I doubled it to use all our kale and subsequently had to cook it for 30 minutes.  I might try mixing all the broth with the potatoes next time as mine was still a little soupy on top, but a delicious recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!"
138531,83475,2005-07-18,5,I use chicken tenders(cut up)1/3 cup dried basil and some white wine...wonderful!!!
32253,18888,2013-08-04,5,"In all my years of cooking I&#039;ve never been able to make a good lasagna until now and this one was GREAT!  The only thing I did different was use my homemade sauce that I had leftover in the freezer http://www.food.com/recipe/spaghetti-sauce-25668   Thank you so much for posting, I will be making this over and over again."
610698,57919,2009-03-11,5,This really is wonderful for how quick and easy it is to make! We used Codfish which worked perfectly fine for us!
1224769,246518,2013-08-22,0,"Way too many ingredients, most of which are not really necessary.  Spice and sauce it up yourself and end up with a better dish.  And for God&#039;s sake, skip the butter!"
811594,54257,2010-09-13,0,Excellent and easy.  We did make a second batch of sauce to serve with it too.
1336779,37336,2010-03-25,5,Oh my gosh!  So easy and absolutely fool-proof delicious!   The name fits - this dish will make regular appearances at our house!
365429,191479,2007-10-08,3,"I thought this was good. The calvados really punches the apple flavor. The only thing I recommend, is doing it a day ahead of time so you can skim off the two inches of fat off the top. 
IT was really really greasy for me."
205398,37548,2005-12-11,5,"Oh my, this was fabulous.  Wouldn't change a thing!  Everyone gobbled it down on Turkey Day.  The spices were just right and I also piped whipped cream around the edges which added a nice touch.  Not a single crack in the top thanks to the water bath.  Thanks for this great recipe!!"
1277480,13906,2009-12-01,5,"This was delicious, easy, and cheap, which is the holy triumvirate of recipes, if you ask me. If I'm smart, I'll make this one of my family's staples."
713116,287617,2008-06-24,5,"Excellent!  I used bone-in pork chops; after rinsing off the brine, I seasoned with cracked pepper and grilled.  Absolutely wonderful, thanks!"
229619,14049,2006-04-16,5,This was dessert for our Easter dinner.  It was wonderful!  I loved the apricot filling.  That made this more than just a coconut cake.  
300721,99966,2018-05-07,5,"These were light and fluffy....just delicious. Simple to make, and a keeper of a recipe."
538401,63357,2007-07-16,5,"I have made fruit pizza before, but the ""frosting"" on this one is the best I have ever tried!  Very light and fluffy!  I used only half of each ingredient for the frosting...yummy!"
678857,152638,2011-02-20,5,"I'm going to make a confession - I have never eaten a caper before.  I'm going to make a 2nd confession - I hope I never eat another caper again.  Other than eating a caper, the chicken was absolutely delicious.  I enjoyed pounding the chicken to a nice, thin piece of meat that cooked up quickly.  Instead of olive oil, I substituted a tablespoon of organic butter. The inside of the chicken was moist and the outside slightly crisp, a perfect contrast.  The flavor was superb!  A very easy and tasty dinner. Thank you very much for posting this recipe."
74868,18732,2007-04-29,2,This really did not appeal to me or my family.  It tasted more like a potato soup than beans and I felt it needed more flavor.
457661,213521,2007-03-18,5,"I made this a little differently than the recipe: I did not use thyme, as my husband is allergic, and I made it all in the crockpot, browning the meat first and then just throwing everything else in. I used frozen pearl onions, and let it simmer for about 5 hours. I served it over rice, and added a bit more salt. It came out fantastic! My 2 year old son, who never eats meat, ate 2 bowls of it! Thank you so much for this recipe. I will definitely be making this again."
2001297534,416835,2017-04-22,5,I made this recipe as written with the exception of using spicy V-8 juice instead of tomato juice. This came out very tasty. Thanks.
91392,220110,2007-06-04,5,"Big 5 stars.  More than 5 would be right.  I used bacon, didn't precook crst but did use the big tart pan, only about a third or less of the cheese and all milk and this was still great, it would have to be better if you didn't lighten it up, I'm only writing my changes so I can do them again.  I did use quite a bit of leek and I did fry them in the bacon grease and I think that was a good idea for taste.  No thyme, but it would be nice too I'm sure.I'm already thinking about how many times I'm going to make this for company and picnics this summer, excellent recipe and pretty."
505183,208237,2009-01-23,5,"I was about to post this recipe myself, but did a quick search to see if it was already out here.  This is a favorite around my house!!  If I'm feeling lazy, I just use tub butter -- spread it on the rolls, then sprinkle with the paprika and garlic powder."
1802175966,134925,2014-01-10,4,"Lovely, tasty meal which everyone enjoyed.  Did mine slightly differently, instead of frying the chicken breasts, after coating I placed them in a roasting bag and cooked them in the oven on 200*C for 40 minutes.  Chicken then cooks in its own juices.  I will be making these again soon."
1202811,41489,2014-02-14,5,"I forgot the lemon and they were still delicious. I also used 18% cream instead of whipping cream, because it&#039;s what I had on hand."
125128,39892,2004-02-19,5,"This was a very easy recipe to make and the taste was exceptional!  I did make a few adjustments and it turned out great.  I added chopped celery with the veggies, more spices like bay leaf, marjoram, and savory, and omitted the peas.  I also used boneless chicken breast because my family doesn't like the taste of chicken thighs, and added about 1 tbsp. of parsley to the dumpling mixture for a little color.  I cooked this on high because I was in a hurry and it's a good thing that I did because it took about 5-6 hours for the veggies to be soft. I will definitely add this to my overflowing recipe collection.  Thanks Rhonda! :) "
262312,74388,2007-05-04,5,"This is a great recipe!  I found it off the McCormick website.  I used an inexpensive cut of meat, marinated overnight and had tender, juicy, flavorful steaks for dinner.  Served with baked potatoes and asparagus with feta #88880.  Spectacutar meal!!  Thanks for posting, Marie"
258414,49737,2005-11-09,5,"This is a very good copy of Panera's soup.  I will definitely make this again, as my boyfriend is a big fan of the soup and loved this recipe."
2000735453,43023,2018-02-19,4,Sauce had good flavor but was very thick and goopy. I added more chicken broth and seasoning. Personal taste.
1108749,353819,2009-02-18,5,"Fantastic!  This was really easy and very good.  My carniverous father in law didn't even know they were veggie burgers until I told him.  I might try some different seasoning the next time, but all in all, they were great.  Also, very filling.  I served them with fresh sliced roma tomatoes and french fries, it was a great meal.  Thank you so much for posting this.  We will use this recipe again for sure."
22724,69519,2008-08-15,5,I will never again be overwhelmed by a bumper crop of cucumbers!  We opted to use chives instead of sliced onion and added a few cherry tomatoes to the mix.  I am also partial to using rice wine vinegar for a bit more subtle tang.  I don't know that I have ever been so pleased with the balance of sweetness and tanginess that your dish provides.  With the perfect sweetness/tanginess combined with the dill and chives it was one of the best flavor explosions I have experienced!  Thanks for this GREAT recipe!  :)
811594,310146,2008-06-28,5,Good.  Very quick and easy too!  My family loved it.
111342,10510,2008-12-18,5,"One of my very favorite things to take to a party.  A real crowd pleaser, and diferent than all the salty and greasy stuff that usually shows up on the table at a gathering.  YUMMY."
486725,229781,2012-08-27,4,"This has all the right ingredients, I think it is just a matter of spicing it to your liking. We added tabasco and lemon at the table and doubled the paprika (I used smoked). I also tried to make it easier and more suited to our tastes, so skipped the egg and used canned garbanzos (with crisped bacon - but less - to top it). The Spanish flavor definitely shines through, which is really nice. I thought the serving size was appropriate; we ate this as a meal."
305531,154502,2006-07-16,5,This is a great dish. Our company loved it. Thanks for posting. 
1072593,180421,2011-06-25,5,Garlic lovers unite.  We NEED to unit because nobody else will sit with us while we're creating a microclimate with our garlic aromas.  WONDERFUL!
372163,206728,2007-07-01,4,Great summer fruit salad.
2001829426,333838,2017-11-28,5,We really like this recipe. I used 4 small loaf pans approx. 5 3/4 &quot;x 3 .25&quot;. These cooked perfectly at 325 degrees convection for 30 minutes. I'm sure a regular oven would do the same. I only used the pumpkin pie spice as we don't care for things too spicey. I never add salt to any recipe and it still turned out perfectly. I appreciate getting this recipe. My husband Jerry says he loves it. It is still hot and he is eating it. We could not wait till tomorrrow. Mary Wenger/Gainesville GA
156034,5390,2006-04-26,3,"This didn't work out well at all.  It was more of an exercise in futility.

No idea what size pan or what temp to use made it impossible to figure out if this tasted like it was supposed to or if it was the correct density.

The flavor of the batter was good and edges of the cake were good, but in a 13x9 pan, it was too thin.

If you would post the pan size and temp for oven, I will try it again!

1105991,314152,2012-05-24,5,"My little girl wants one of those big cookie pizzas that they have at the grocery store every time we go by them.  I always say ""no way, we can make one of those that'll taste way better than that one"".  I used your recipe to make her one for her 9th birthday and it was a huge hit!  I put it in a big enameled cast iron skillet like you suggested.  I let it cool a while before carefully popping it out so it wouldn't break apart.  I put it on a pizza tray, put whipped cream and sprinkles around the edge and a candle in the center.  She was so happy.  We were too because this was REALLY delicious.  I thought it was super simple to make too.  Thanks Chef Jean for posting this one!  I'll be making it often."
124249,121897,2005-05-18,4,"Well, I had to try this even though the  corn in the store wasn't the greatest. This made the corn very moist with a slight sweet taste. I am going to try it again when the corn is better. 
Was easy to make. 

Thanks KITTENCAL.

107583,271762,2008-10-04,5,Now I know what to do with that bottle of tequila that has been sitting around for a year!  Thanks for the laugh.
901714,50763,2008-12-30,4,This one was a hit with my 4 kids which is rare!  I did not use dry pinto beans but added a large (28oz) can after I thawed it.  Thanks for posting this TIsh!
486725,221822,2009-11-15,4,"This is tasty, and comforting on a fall night. We used less salt, fresh ginger, whole wheat couscous and subbed spinach for the okra. Thanks!"
296809,260486,2008-01-30,4,"I halved this recipe, added garlic only which I see as a must & got 4 servings as shown in the pic. The potatoes I used were smaller than normal baking size & I just halved them. They did not appear to be browning well, so I used more of the reserved butter + the fan setting of my convection oven. Voila! We both loved the buttery-rich, lemon flavor! I felt the coating tasted more of flour than desired, but DH did not agree. It surprised me that they were even better the 2nd dy when rewarmed & crisped again in the oven. Thx for sharing this sure-to-be repeated recipe w/us. Yum!"
52924,27841,2003-05-29,5,These are so so good! DH and Kids devoured them. Will definantly be making them again.
573325,341712,2009-09-13,4,"This is a tasty and healthy soup that was enjoyed by the whole family!
Your directions are easy to follow and the end result is a creamy soup with a distinct and strong celery taste and just a hint of leek and garlic.
Next time I think Ill reduce the amount of celery used and increase the amount of leek as I think that way the soup would taste even better for me.
Being a vegetarian, I used veggie stock in place of the chicken stock.
THANKS SO VERY MUCH for sharing this lovely recipe with us, Muddyboots!
Made and reviewed for one of my babies during Fall PAC 09."
2218233,79563,2013-07-04,5,Just awesome!! The entire family loved it. I also added some lima beans and garlic. I love how easy it was. I didn&#039;t let the peas stay for an hour. Just brought it to a boil and dumped everything else in. Super easy and super healthy and best of all delicious. I will be making this again shortly!
958462,260053,2008-09-17,2,Taste more like a slaw.  Very bland compared to the real deal.  It's  an ok recipe but I would change the name of it.  It is really misleading.  Those who have not eaten kim chee might be turned off or disapointed when they try kim chee for the fist time.  I would name it  Not Authentic Easy Kim Chee Slaw.  But like I said before it's ok but it seems to be missing somthing.
798181,412357,2010-04-10,4,Made for PRMR & I am so glad i did. Very flavorful. Used it on a london broil & it was so good. Might cut down the garlic powder just a tiny bit next time
35106,49699,2006-11-12,1,"It was too dry, and I didn't like the mix of seasonings very much. I had to improvise and throw in 2 cans of mushroom soup diluted in water. :)"
542159,178300,2010-08-12,5,Yummy! My mother used to make these when we were in high school and over the years I had kind of forgotten about them and how good they are. Made one tiny change which was to use low-fat mayonnaise instead of Miracle Wip. These yummy tomatoes are going back into my regular rotation of recipes. Thanks for the memories and for bring back a great recipe.
1946583,80411,2011-07-02,5,Delicious cake with scrumptious icing!!  I made a double batch of icing to make sure there was enough....was able to generously ice the cake and had icing left over...well worth the effort....will definitely bake this one again!
75276,284585,2010-09-16,5,"I try to reduce the maple as much as I can, and I usually have a blood sugar rush with maple, but I make the exception for this recipe. Very good taste and accepts substitutes for whatever I have on hand. Will be trying it with Bragg's Amino Acids today instead of soy sauce."
248023,103024,2008-07-28,5,"I will NEVER buy packaged pudding mix again!!!  I made this exactly as written EXCEPT instead of the vanilla extract, I scraped half a vanilla bean into the mixture.  It gave this pudding a wonderful aroma while cooking and a beautiful presentation with all the flecks running through it.  My BF and I really enjoyed this vanilla bean pudding for dessert.  I even cooked it in the microwave to save dirtying up another pan...  I used a 4c pyrex cup and microwaved it for 3 minutes, stirred, then in 2 minute increments until thickened... Loved it!  Thanks so much for sharing!!!"
383346,342643,2009-01-01,4,"I used 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder, and added a little envelop of sugar twin.  It was great but I'll prefer it with milk.  So I'll try it with milk another time.  Thanks Melissa.  Made for 123 hit wonders"
687043,83957,2007-12-13,2,Just made this tonight for dinner.  It was rather bland for our taste.  Next time I make it I will have to spice it up.
236959,14128,2006-05-22,3,"This didn't really turn out like a pie, more like the ""rhubarb cookie"" another reviewer mentioned.  Although this was an incredibly quick and simple recipe to put together, the ""cookie"" part of it was kind of spongy and bland.  Not bad, just not really to our liking and we won't be making it again."
382071,86066,2007-01-30,4,"These were very nice, soft and sweet. Pretty too. It's funny when you look at them you almost expect them to be chocolate chip cherry bars but nope! I wonder if dried cherries would also work? Thanks for the unusual recipe to try. Made for 1-2-3 hit wonders."
704171,164457,2007-12-30,5,"This is a wonderful dish, creamy and smooth like an egg pouched in cream.  Being Italian I truly believe Parmesan cheese makes anything good.  I did add an extra egg and a touch of Kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper and garnished with parsley flakes.  I served this up with Toasted Focaccia bread, coffee and for the sweet a slice of Blond Brown toped with mini chocolate chips. As Paula Dean would say, â€œThis is heavenly ya-all!â€�"
21443,140531,2005-10-09,4,"Make this all the time at home, everyone loves it.  It is fast and simple to make, serve with your fave veggie, salad and fresh bread!!  YUM!"
149242,438737,2014-11-30,5,"Very good recipe that I have made many times.  I like to make the balls a bit bigger, using about a 1/4 cup of the ganache for each one.  I still use 1 cup of milk with one ball to make the hot chocolate.  Rich and delish."
517978,54257,2009-05-30,4,I really liked the flavor of this meatloaf. This is what I did different. I used 15 to 20 crackers instead of the bread and about 1/4 c of half & half. I made 4 small loaves and cooked in on a cookie sheet and it got a nice carmelized coating. I really love it !!!
2897127,144990,2013-07-11,4,"Sounds fat, I&#039;m in!!!"
176615,103437,2004-12-07,4,"Love that Paula Deen! I made this last night and it was very tender and the flavor was quite good. My one complaint is that for a 3 lb roast in my 5 qt crockpot, water to cover is just too much. I knew this but went ahead and cooked the roast 8 hours. It was swimming, like soup, which also watered down the flavors. Served it with some extra seasoning mix and it was fine, but next time I won't add so much water. If it were prepared in a 3 1/2 or 4 qt crockpot, it would probably be fine. Thanks, Marie, for posting!"
860079,6509,2009-04-16,5,"Very similar to my regular deviled eggs, except for the dill relish. I LOVE dill pickles (I put them in my potato salad) so these were just perfect for me, DH and DD too! Thanks *Z* ~ made for PAC Spring 2009!"
403281,43780,2009-08-18,5,"Delicious and a huge hit!  the consistency is a little different than a boxed cake. I added blakc gel ""seeds"" to the top to make it look even better!  I also used watermelon jello.  And I added a little food coloring to the frosting to get the desired colors."
2000245595,99599,2015-10-20,5,"Super easy and tasty.  I had it fresh out of the oven with some butter and it tasted like a high-quality bistro or bakery bread.  Looking forward to try it with some sharp cheddar for lunch tomorrow.  I followed the recipe almost exactly as written, but omitted the lemon zest and for the 3/4 cup of wine or juice, I used 3/4 cup of a mixture of half Riesling, half apple cider, and a splash of lemon juice.  I will absolutely make this again."
841895,354234,2016-09-04,4,"I didn't follow this recipe exactly, but when my initial plan to make a hot dog, mashed potatoes, and cabbage fell through, I took inspiration from it. I wrapped the hot dog in a slice of cheese, put it in a bun, and then topped it with mashed potatoes. It was surprisingly good! Thank you!"
126440,34011,2010-07-29,4,"These were very good but one side burned, so would either turn down my oven or turn over half way through cooking time or both."
630176,167729,2008-07-13,5,"I was out of bread crumbs and bread. I came across this recipe and was so happy I did. I used  Saltine crackers.
Thanks Jim !!!!!!"
209603,127697,2005-07-10,3,"this was a very time consuming salad to make, it didnt really taste like your traditional potatoe salad we decided it was the cider vinegar. it was more like a vegetable salad with some potatoes, it was ok but i would probably omit some of the veggies and add a more traditional dressing to it if i made it again."
586291,21304,2012-09-03,5,Very good! I doubled it with extra bacon but kept everything else the same. Very tasty side with BBQ! Thank you for a great recipe!
717459,7413,2008-01-11,4,I served this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. It had a great flavor to it.
1220686,394801,2011-04-22,4,"This is a good basic tuna recipe with a mild flavor.  I was worried the dill or mustard would be too strong, but they blend well with the tuna flavor.  I left out the celery, as my kids don't like the extra crunch, and also used mayo."
39301,158648,2006-07-05,5,"Thanks for sharing this.  It's a very easy, tasty and guiltless recipe!  I used light mayo, which actually made it 3 pts per serving, but I look forward to making the no points version too!"
95810,95012,2004-07-08,5,Yummy!  This gives the corn a wonderful flavor.  I only soaked it for about 30 minutes and then grilled for about 25 minutes.  We made about 10 ears of corn this way.  Grilling the corn really intensifies the sweetness.  We just served with butter and salt and pepper.  Excellent recipe!
374115,16531,2007-03-06,4,"I used skinless boneless chicken breast tenderloins, and only cooked for a little over 4 hours, and they turned out perfectly.  Will make again."
55729,82697,2011-08-18,0,"I found these kind of plain and a bit bready. My husband thought they were ok at first, but the breadiness must have been exacerbated by freezing, because after they were thawed he tasted it too. I did use hot dog buns instead of real bread, so I won't give stars in case that was the problem. (Otherwise, I would have to give 2*.)"
243291,137286,2005-09-15,5,sent this to daughter in school..she said it was good and her roomates liked it too
77867,145302,2005-11-23,5,Tried these the other night and found them very easy.  Everyone loved them and know that I will be making these again.  Followed the recipe to the T and them came out delicious.
47510,47690,2003-07-10,5,"Thanks so much for daring me to make this!  This dish was enjoyed by everyone in the family, even my 3 yr old (who eats almost nothing).  I did make a couple of additions - a can of mushrooms and some minced garlic.  I think next time I make this, I'll also add in some pepperoni.  I couldn't find plain mozzarella at the grocery store, so I bought a cheddar/mozzarella blend.  To accompany this recipe, I served a simple salad and rolls.  My whole family thanks you for a great recipe!"
39733,30832,2002-07-26,5,"OH WOW!! This was so easy and the taste was yummy. I used my own garden-grown herbs. The cayenne, which we love, gave it just the right amount of zippiness. We grilled this along with some chicken and just added a green salad. Perfect summer meal. Smiles all around :)"
93006,69782,2003-10-06,3,"Good, but not exciting enough to make again."
906581,236921,2008-12-12,4,"Nice recipe, I didn't cook it for as long as I don't like my pepper that soft, so I did it for 30 minutes."
1701779,189156,2010-10-10,0,"I took another bakers advice and added 2 tbsp butter, 1 tsp vanila extract, 3/4 C. Icing sugar to the Cream cheese. I also subbed 2 Cups of whole wheat flour leaving 1 white, used 2 egg whites and 2 eggs instead of 4, and for 3/4 of the Vegetable Oil, I subbed homemade applesauce. <br/>These were amazing!!! I tend to think Starbucks muffins are a little too 'cakey,' and these do still have a lot of sugar. But they were super moist and turned out absolutely perfectly with the directions on the recipe. I'll definitely make them again for my husband and I!"
302094,192946,2008-10-20,5,"I made this last night for dinner. This was easy to make and yes a little time consuming, but well worth it. I followed the recipe excactly, we will be making this again for sure. Thanks so much for posting!"
296809,54312,2007-03-27,5,"This lovely banana bread turned out great just as you advertised, Juenessa ... moist & full of the banana flavor. I did not have any of the optional nuts, so left them out & otherwise made it just as written. There was a moment early on in the baking when I thot it might overflow my loaf pan, but all was fine. Mine was nicely done 10 min earlier than expected, but my convection oven often cooks hot & fast. DH is in Vienna for a wk, so I indulged myself w/2 generous taste tests & froze the rest for his return. It seemed only fair to share this yummy treat w/him & I am sure he will be grateful you shared the recipe w/us. :-)"
269243,76864,2007-05-15,5,"Excellent!
I followed the tips for the filling and added 2 TBSP of flour to it.

I've also tried adding pecan pieces to the filling and it comes out great!"
340272,414196,2011-07-12,5,"Simple to make, very tasty.  The lemon juice is the secret, I think."
1027074,13221,2009-04-26,2,"My husband liked these, which is unusual because he doesn't like sweet potatoes.  That said, I was very disappointed.  They were soggy and limp and NEVER crisped up at all.  We couldn't get enough liquid to drink with these - they were VERY salty, spicy, peppery.  Even my vegan daughter didn't care for them.  If I did something wrong in the preparation - let me know - HOW do you get crispy oven sweet potatoes??"
102352,99150,2004-12-06,5,This is the only way I will make spaghetti sauce from now on!  I only had 1 lb. of beef and kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  The taste was great and the leftover sauce was thick enough for delicious meatball sandwiches.
569582,17227,2010-03-19,5,"Perfect, quick, and easy biscuits - Just like my grandmother used to make. Love them! Thank you so much for this recipe. It makes a great addition to many breakfasts and dinners. And tastes 100 times better than those 'biscuits' you get out of a can."
1811929,456285,2018-01-14,0,"This is, without a doubt, one of the finest fish receipes I've ever made, and I am NOT a gourmet cook! Low cal? No, but the mayo crust makes this one of the most moist, flavorful dishes I've ever had. The only thing I did different was reduce the baking time as my filets were only about 3/4 inch....I baked them about 18 minutes."
2001358130,96815,2017-01-19,5,I added a little sugar to the eggs and milk and it turned out extra tasty. Would like to try with little salt n pepper next time.
545825,74710,2010-01-31,4,"This was really good.  I made some changes:  I used ground beef instead of lamb (my regular store doesn't carry lamb and I wasn't up for a quest!)  I also used ciabatta bread....I don't even know what turkish bread is.  Instead of the coriander/cumin, I used a turkish spice blend (which according to the jar contains:  salt, garlic, cumin, black pepper, oregano, paprika, sumac, cayenne pepper and cilantro.)  I have enough of the meat mixture to make dinner tomorrow night.  Thanks for posting."
2002292423,274177,2018-10-05,5,"Made this after an associate from Sudan told me about the dish. Not difficult to make at all, although I would suggest 2 people to make the Msemmen. Brought it into work and it was an absolute hit. My associate from Sudan was completely surprised. I've been asked to make it several times since. Also, I've made the sauce a couple times as a standalone dish and served it with msemmen. I've done it with chicken stock and vegetable stock (for the vegans in my group) instead of water. Also very delicious. Thank you for sharing this great recipe."
64203,71360,2004-04-17,5,"These are some of the best breadsticks I've made. Soft, chewy, and delicious! This recipe makes a lot too, so I was able to share these with my neighbors!
Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!"
41758,76658,2004-11-09,5,"This chili was EXCELLENT!!  I only used 1 jalapeno because, frankly, I was scared!  I also used Ranch-style beans and added some sliced olives and cilantro.  It was the best chili I've ever had and relatively easy to make as well! Thanks for the great recipe."
1823535,430121,2011-02-09,5,Great Job.
187927,234862,2008-08-27,4,"A very tasty alternative to traditional guac. The basil added a distinct refreshing quality to it that my fiance and I both enjoyed (and we REALLY love guacamole). The only change I made was using garlic salt instead of table salt, but that's because we love garlic in our guac anyway. We did miss having the cumin one usually finds in guacamole, however. I think that if I found myself with an overabundance of basil, this would be a nice use for it. I might just include the cumin next time, and a bit more garlic."
844554,361968,2009-12-06,5,Very tasty! I used 4-5 garlic cloves (we love it) and cut the recipe in half. I only had parmesan cheese but it was still good. Thanks for this one. Made for I Recommend Tag Game 2009.
374520,166559,2008-02-04,5,"My husband loved these.  I made them this morning and prepackaged them for his lunch.  He called me raving about them and how they made his day!  Thanks for posting such an easy recipe, I got them made before he was even finished getting ready.  I wish that I could taste them because they smell awesome but my milk allergy won't let me :(  Thank you again for posting such a great sweet snack recipe."
164645,15210,2004-09-25,5,"I tried one of the Reviewer suggestions, and used 1/2 cup Chicken Broth. I then used just 1 1/2 cup Apple juice. I also substituted Uncle Ben's wild rice with regular wild rice.  It turned out delicious!!  This was a family hit and will definitely be used again."
8688,162700,2006-07-12,5,"Paula, this tuna is THE best tuna salad I have EVER tasted, anywhere!  The blend of curry with the crystalized ginger is a winning combination!  The cayenne and Dijon are just enough to wake you up and the red onions and pecans give it personality!  This would have made a great sandwich, but I simply couldn't resist eating it straight from the bowl. : )  Thanks, Paula, for another great recipe!"
323824,204860,2009-12-26,5,"I made these cookies, along with other cookies, as gifts for co-workers and for the family.  This was the only recipe that I was asked to share.  A favorite for everyone!  It's the day after Christmas and here I am making another batch!  And so simple...."
362919,228200,2007-05-21,4,"just made these - i excluded the chocolate chips and only put pecans in half, they stick to the cookie sheet something fierce so make sure you grease them up well, it wasnt the cookie i was expecting but they turned out well, comparable to your average peanut butter cookie with pockets of caramel in them - thanks for the recipie"
1803193778,134270,2014-10-03,1,"Well, I don&#039;t know what I did wrong. I followed the directions perfectly and had a lot of fun making them, but they turned out horrible. I expected something like an elephant ear or fluffy doughnut almost, instead I got little biscuits. I&#039;m not sure what I should&#039;ve added more or less of, but they were quite the disappointment. The insides taste undone and the outside is like a biscuit. Maybe my oil was too hot? Although, the stove was only on 2/5. &lt;br/&gt;I remember my mom would make these and I loved them. If anyone could tell me what I may have done wrong, I greatly appreciate it. Like I said, these made correctly are amazing from what I remember. For some reason mine just didn&#039;t turn out at all. :/"
2379461,184793,2013-07-24,5,These are amazing!
86512,69735,2003-12-12,4,"This is really good. When I first decided to make this recipe for dinner, I did not realize it had to be marinated overnight. I marinated it for about 5 or 6 hours instead. I grilled it on my tabletop, electric, crockery grill.  The chop was still good. I had a baked potato with it. I brought  the remaining marinade to a boil in a saucepan and cooked it for about 5 minutes.  I didn't thicken it. I spooned some of it over my baked potato. It made the potato quite tasty.  Next time I make this, I will marinate the chops overnight, or 12 hours as the recipe suggests doing. Thanks Roger for a great recipe. "
581040,68955,2008-03-16,4,"The flavor of the sauce was phenomenal, however I didn't care for the texture of the chicken.  The skin of the chicken was very rubbery so it made it difficult to focus on the wonderful flavor.   I will be doing some experimentations with this because I truly like the flavor.  Thank you for sharing."
956843,293770,2008-10-29,5,This was delicious. I added some chopped celery and onion with the garlic and added fat free cheddar cheese and pepper at the end. Fast and tasty lunch. Thanks for posting!
58762,116887,2010-12-02,5,This was really good and really easy! I used cinnamon graham crackers from Trader Joe's and the result was REALLY good!
2084981,348802,2011-12-21,5,I love this recipe my husband and I are on a super tight budget and sometimes I just crave Olive Garden. With this recipe I do not have to break the budget to get something I love. This most recent time I made my soup out of leftover roasted chicken and my own gnocchi out of the leftover mashed potatoes and it turned out amazing. Not only is this an awesome recipe it is also great for using up leftovers.
807161,31311,2008-12-22,5,"These were a great, simple addition to my Christmas cookie trays!  I made these as written and you really have to make sure you do not make the cookies balls too big or you won't be able to get them out of the pan.  Also make sure they are cooled completely before removing from the muffin tin.  Thanks again!"
63858,17031,2009-01-03,5,I have made this twice now.  I also hate Mayo.  This is perfect as is very good kept in small crock pot to keep warm.
185293,65643,2006-12-10,5,"I knew I'd like this when I saw the ingredients, but WOW it was better than I thought! This is how I will be making potatoes here from now on.  Very easy and full of great flavor.  A family pleaser. Thanks kitten!!"
2001381863,443684,2017-02-06,1,doesn't taste at all like mayo
190478,51295,2005-01-25,5,"Ran across this recipe cause my girlfriend try to make Banh Mi but not sure of all the ingredients.  Eventhough this is an Americanized version of Banh Mi Thit it will do if you've never had a Vietnamese sandwich.

Banh Mi is the bomb!!  When I was little living in Saigon, Vietnam ....very time we were out and about we always make sure to hit up those sandswich stands for Banh  Mi Thit."
6357,98001,2005-03-04,4,"This is a wonderful dish. I made it for dinner tonight for myself. It got some real good taste, thanks to the curry powder!{I noticed this ingredient listed in the instructions but you forgot to mention it in the list of ingredients}. I used 1 1/2 tsps. of curry powder. The only ingredient that I did not use is yoghurt. Since I didn't have jalapeno pepper on hand{hard to get it here}, I used 1 green bell pepper, chopped as a substitute. I used a little less than 3/4 tsp. of salt. I used chopped ginger and garlic instead of pastes. This was a really fine dish and I will certainly make it again. Thanks for posting the recipe :)     "
199902,51861,2005-03-16,5,This is a very good pizza sauce.  Next time I make it  I will probably cut the red wine down to 1/2 - 1 tablespoon as it had a very strong flavor.  I got lots of compliments on my pizza!  Thanks Kim D.!
310001,42972,2007-02-12,5,I just made this for lunch today and it is excellent!! Thank you for posting this great recipe.
174096,410595,2010-02-19,5,Tasty dip!  There is a nice little kick from the jalapenos that really balances out the sweetness from the corn.  I used fat free mayo and a 4 cheese blend that included jack and cheddar.  Thanks for sharing!
59780,50774,2004-12-13,5,"This is a wonderful addition to my OAMC collection. I am not a big meat eater so these were perfect for me. I deforsted these overnight in the fridge, baked for an hour and then served with breadsticks. I will be making these again soon~maybe then I can snap a better picture too! Thanks for posting this recipe."
179133,133333,2006-03-05,5,This was very tasty! I could only find 8 oz bags of shrimp and didn't want leftovers so just used it all. Also replaced pecans with walnuts (what I had on hand). Thanks for the recipe ugogirl!
1951394,17658,2011-07-30,5,Love this shrimp!!!! :)
235199,305912,2013-04-06,5,Just made a triple batch for a baby shower and OMG!!! So delicious!!!! I rather guessed at the number of grapes so ended up with a little more cream cheese sauce then grapes...guess I&#039;ll   just have use it on different fruits I have here at home for my own little salad!!
88099,101209,2007-02-17,5,Outstanding indeed.  This was so flavorful and tender.  We loved it.  I didn't keep the marinade so I just basted it with the pan juices and that worked well for us.  thanks Oz for a wonderful mean.
906994,190661,2008-07-29,5,This was easy to make and everyone LOVED it! We used real maple syrup. The glaze was also fabulou on boneless chicken breasts prepared the same way as the pork chops.
920506,152728,2008-08-12,5,"This was very good and very simple. I ended up substituting the brown sugar with honey and the Karo syrup with molasses, but it still came out amazing! Definitely something I plan to experiment more with in the future. Thanks for the recipe!"
72489,29679,2003-05-03,4,"What can I add to 102 reviews?  Not much.  These are very rich, very easy and very good.  I am a big fan of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups so needless to say I liked this recipe a lot."
593927,121064,2011-04-06,5,"A nice basic quinoa recipe that does not taste very much of garlic though you may think so based on it's title. I used canola oil instead of vegetable spray, to be soy free, which is not mentioned in the ingredients list BTW, sweet onions, extra carrot, plus the rest of the ingredients. I enjoyed this as a vegetarian main dish mixed with an arugula salad and recipe#452710. The dressing went very well with this quinoa dish. I also made it into a cold salad which we didn't enjoy as much. I'd like to make this again using the introduction mentioned, roasted garlic."
253974,39864,2005-11-08,5,"This is an awesome recipe! I had been trying different recipes for years, some were ok, some were terrible, but this one was JUST RIGHT! said the baby bear! LOL. Seriously tho, this is the last meatloaf recipe that I will try. This is IT! The only thing I would , and will cahnge in the future is the topping. It was too mustard-y Will probably do what I usually do, either 1/2 ketchup-1/2 tomato sauce, or maybe 1/2 chili sauce 1/2 tomato sauce. This is a serious meatloaf! Thanks for posting it for us to enjoy."
939002,152924,2012-02-26,4,I tried these this morning and they were great.  Very moist on the inside.  I was able to make 12 small muffins since I don't own a large muffin tin.  <br/><br/>They taste and smell almost like Apple and Cinnamon Oatmeal.  I modified the recipe a little and use Fiji Apples because that is what I had on hand.   My muffins did have a slight after taste but I think this is due to the brand of Apple Butter I used and not the recipes fault.<br/><br/>I will be making these again.
39835,279994,2009-03-16,4,"Very good and easy dish which we enjoyed! Although I set the crockpot for 4 hours, it stayed on warm for at least another 4 hours without any problems. Thanks for sharing!"
223979,188985,2006-10-10,5,"I think this is a really nice dessert drink.  The vanilla vodka really makes this drink smooth.  I used light creme de cacao because that is all I could find, but I do like the dark better.  This is a fun drink that I will definitely make again.  Thanks"
223979,140245,2006-06-18,5,This is a fun recipe!  The kids really enjoyed it.  This will be a new great snack for us!
27366,94990,2006-11-07,5,"This is a great wheat bread recipe.  The first time I screwed up and got it confused with another recipe I had lying on the counter and accidentally made it into four (very small) loaves instead of two.  They tasted great, were just very small!  The second time I got it right and they looked and tasted beautiful.  Thanks for sharing!"
529744,22176,2008-05-04,5,"This was excellent!  I have not made Baked Ziti for a long time because my old recipe was so much work...this is my new favorite!  It was so flavorful, but so easy.  I cut the recipe in half since there are just 2 of us, and it could have easily served 4 so I think the serving size is accurate.  I did not follow the layering directions, I just mixed the sauce and meat together and added a layer of cheese as I put it in the pan.  My DH gave it a 2-thumbs-up, so thanks for the great recipe!"
323389,89198,2006-08-26,4,"So my husband said ""lets make cookies"" and we came to RZ to search recipes.  We had peanut butter and oatmeal in the house,little did I know that there were cookie recipes combining both!  I must've made my cookies a little large beacuse I only got 48, and they took about 15 minutes to cook.  Very nice chewy flavor!"
316254,8972,2009-10-11,2,"I was completely unimpressed with the icing, and then I hardly had enough to even ice the cake with. after trying this icing, I know now that I much prefer cream cheese icing with red velvet."

477411,359020,2009-04-30,4,Very easy throw together. Had frozen blueberries instead of fresh. They were totally flavorless.... Use fresh or dried berries for this. The dried cranberries were really good.

Used fresh strawberries, (not quite a quart) and 3 big frozen ones and I wanted to make sure I had enough for two servings.  I also used bottled lemon juice as I only had one lemon to squeeze.  Oh such summer goodness.  You have made me very very happy today!!!

The sauce flavors the fish so well. This is going into my international seafood category along with the Bok Choy recipe and white rice. Really good."

1445026,355770,2009-12-04,5,I have been looking for the perfect meatball recipe for awhile now and have found it here!  I made my own meatballs in a skillet instead of prepackaged and added onion in with the sauce and they were a hit! No leftovers! Will be making it for the office xmas party coming up soon. DELICIOUS
237123,297004,2008-06-28,4,"Very tasty and quite easy to make.  The stew had just the right seasonings in it, though we like our a little hotter and added more chili pepper flakes.  I changed the rice just a bit- I used a rice maker and half barley (for my own dietary reasons).  Thanks for posting, we liked it."
297303,230792,2007-07-21,5,"I just made this cobbler.  I couldn't wait to eat it.  loved, loved , loved it.  The only change i made was to sprinkle the strawberries with a little sugar.  I also didn't have evaporated milk, so I substitued reg milk.  I'm sure it would be even better with evaporated.  would like to see more recipes from you."
92385,91864,2004-09-09,4,A tasty and attractive side dish ! I too scaled back my ingredients for 4 servings and it was almost too much to handle in my largest frying pan. I think next time I'll cut my zucchini in chunks rather than rounds because I had the problem of my carrots and celery (the smaller items in the pan) all wanting to cling together. I think if the zukes were in chunks things would mix better in the pan- but that might just be a personal problem of mine. Thanks for posting !
1334193,286627,2010-02-20,5,"Yummy!  I had to tweak some of the ingredients a bit and I feel as though some of the measurements in the recipe are either too much or too little.  But, that's the nice thing about this dish, you can make it your way and it's ultra tasty!"
82331,32200,2005-03-05,5,"This was very good!  I used a pound of Tilapia on sale, which doesn't flake that easily, so it stayed together well with the handling.  The flavor was very good and mild.  I may add more spice next time, but it was delicious just like it was.  Will definitely make this again!"
716215,39087,2009-05-07,4,"YUMMY! I doubled the seasonings like others had suggested, added mushrooms, and diced tomatoes instead of sundried tomatoes, and used 1 whipping cream. I really liked it, however the sauce was really thin. I tried adding some flour to thicken it up alittle but it really didnt do anything.  Any suggestions on what I did wrong pls let me know!"
527607,89253,2007-08-06,5,"Superb!  I made this as part of a menu #8077 and it was my appetizer as i waited for the shrimp to marinate.  Really good.  I subbed cilantro for parsley because my parsley had turned off, but i think it was a great substitutions."
96641,192330,2008-02-04,5,"Cooked this for the Super Bowl supper and family loved it.
The sauce never got thick for me and didn't have red Maderia but flavor was good.
I might add some nice smoked bacon or panchetta next time."

140132,52190,2009-06-15,5,"Oh wow this is good.  DD couldn't quit eating this before our dinner was ready....lol.  I loved the bacon in this.  I did add some celery along with the green onions, otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us."
13663,75136,2004-06-08,4,Very good ice cream. Straining the custard mixture before adding it to the chocolate is a good step. 
149432,102674,2005-02-04,4,"If you like cheesy, this is the soup for you.  This is a thick soup.  A little time consuming, but well worth the effort.  Thanks for sharing. "
1060667,269125,2015-08-14,5,"This turned out delicious!!  Kaffir lime leaves are tough to chew to me, and very potent, but I do love the flavor they give off, so I left them whole let them simmer in the sauce, then removed them, kind of like you would treat a bay leaf.  Anyway, this had a great Thai flavor and I served it over cauliflower rice and like someone else suggested, this would go great in lettuce wraps too.  Added some thinly slice yellow bell pepper and onions just to get a few more veggies in there, very nice :)"

I am not a cookie maker but these were easy to put together and they came out beautiful. I used Crisco, I don't care for butter in cookie recipes. I didn't have any raisins, but hopefully if I can get my hands on some more bags I will definately use the raisins the next time.  They are so good I can hardly stay out of them!!  lol"
103876,114327,2011-09-27,5,I love bean salad so was anxious to try this.  It turned out great and was a nice change from the usual which has wax beans that I don't like.  The addition of the carrots added nice color and flavor.  Thanks for posting!
2105128,82511,2012-11-28,5,"You could also modify the crust by using the Nabisco chocolate wafers for the crust      (about 2 1/4 cups), with the addition of 1 tbsp. of sugar (for sweetness) and also the butter.<br/>To amp up the Irish creme flavor, try 3/4 to 1 cup Irish creme for an enhanced flavor."

191050,67422,2005-02-28,5,"This was a simple and tasty recipe.  Whenever I bread things it tends to come out soggy, but this breading was perfect!  The only thing I would do different is to add the cheese 2-3 minutes before it's done...seemed like the cheese didn't need the whole 5 minutes to melt.
Thanks for this great recipe!"

842751,381556,2009-07-14,5,"I had to make this for lunch today when my sister came over. Her husband hates tuna in anything so when she is here, I like to give her tuna as she loves it and never gets it at home. I made a few changes to suit our taste. I added 1 can of drained peas (no carrots). I also added 1/4 c sour cream to the mayonnaise. I used fresh white button mushrooms sliced and sauteed them with the onion before adding to the casserole.  I only use white albacore chunk tuna in the gold can because that's what we like the best. I used a can of Campbell's healthy request low sodium mushroom soup and it didn't make this casserole ""gross"" at all. We loved it. I think next time, I will try it with  the celery soup but keep the sour cream in there.  This is realy a good base for tuna casserole....one of the better ones I have tried. Thanks for sharing it."

1801557627,17449,2013-12-30,4,"im gong to give it 4 stars because it probably tasted good. it smelt delicious and made my mouth water but sadly today my friend got her appendix taken out and this stuff looked like them so our family had to toss it, because it grossed us out. But then it smelt amazing so u should make it!"
212497,280027,2011-02-25,5,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this at first but it was really good. I followed the instructions with the exceptions that I used all hot sausage, skipped the jalapenos (since I used all hot sausage) and added a little bit more chili powder. I also used Great Northern beans instead of pinto beans since I didn't have any on hand. I was worried that it was going to be watery but after letting it cook with the lid off for the final half hour, it thickened up nicely. We served it with sweet cornbread and a salad. I think this may become our ""go to"" chili recipe! Thanks for posting!"
89831,111786,2006-08-21,5,"This was different, we enjoyed it, but I will leave out the fresh bean sprouts next time I make it, they got very hard while baking, or mabey I will used canned, I did make some amount adjustments and increased the cooked chicken way up. thanks for sharing Kel!...Kitten:)"

I really enjoyed the flavor of these light and fluffy, crisp yet tender waffles.  I can't wait to make these again. I served them garnished with a little powdered sugar, it was perfect. I could have eaten them all.  Thank you so much to you and your sister in law for sharing this tasty recipe.  Made for the Winner of the Recipe of the Day Game. Comfort Cafe /09"
133174,148703,2006-01-22,5,"Made this using egg substitute for the eggs, the potato was well scubbed and unpeeled, other than that the only thing I did was to put it under the broiler for a few minutes to brown lightly before serving.  This is a very attractive dish and was great for Sunday morning brunch."
1198738,13858,2010-01-21,5,"Very good.  Still having trouble getting them thin enough, but the taste is awesome."

I made it 3 times already and it tests like heaven! exactly like in Athens!!! I got so many compliments from my husband , my daughter and friends, people who loves Greek food  too. I just want to say Bravo Evelyn!!! Thank you very much for a little peace of Greece on my plate  which I enjoy very much-:)"
329618,39618,2007-07-19,5,Excellent Fried Chicken recipe.  I have always been afraid of frying chicken but have overcome my fear because of this recipe. Thanks for the recipe.
266635,393143,2011-06-22,5,"It has been a long time since I have had stewed okra and this recipe did not disappoint.  I served it with some brown rice and stuffed bell peppers.  Recipe made for the Rosemary/Oregano tag - June, 2011."
1338684,46596,2009-12-10,5,"Good spicy chili! 
I couldn't find any 8 ounce cans of Rotel tomatoes, only 10 ounce cans. So I used 2 cups.
A few other changes I made was using 1 can kidney beans and 1 can of mild chili beans, adding 1 cup of frozen corn, 1 tablespoon of tomato paste and 1 teaspoon of sugar."
476278,139579,2010-02-09,5,"I saw this recipe in the same magazine, and made it for supper. My mom absolutely loved it. I didn't have scallions so I just used baby onions but it still was delicious!"
424680,205883,2008-04-15,5,"GREAT TASTING SAUCE, & just the thing for my son & his wife who are wanna be vegetarians! Made up a double batch &, after tasting it for myself, sent it home with them! Almost reduced the amount of chili flakes, but am glad that I didn't ~ The taste was just right! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees for this Spring's Pick-A-Chef]"
203111,78579,2009-01-27,0,"I'm not going to rate this because I figure nearly 130 people can't be wrong.  But I wanted to say that I used this on a cookie sheet.  I now have a cookie sheet that is a mess and it's going to take me forever to get it cleaned up.  Where there wasn't food, this stuff is stuck on there worse than glue.  Don't know if I didn't stir it enough first or what but thought I should warn others of this possibility."
2000024173,411717,2017-04-02,5,"I just made a double batch of these. This recipe calls for flour, to make it gluten free I subbed 2 different gluten free flours, I also added 3 more farm fresh large eggs than it called for and about 1 + cup of almond milk because gluten free flour needs more liquid than regular flour. I added a half cup of hemp seeds, a cup of chocolate chips, about 1.5 -2 cups mixed nuts, dates, craisins and raisins that I threw into the ninja food processor first, along with the steel cut oats. I did not soak the oats first as other review's said they did and they are still AMAZING! Great for a quick snack or a nutritional breakfast!"
33588,8814,2007-07-30,5,"We loved it!!I did add about 3 more tbls.of broth and at the end added some butter,also didn't have fresh parsley so used dry.Next time I will have fresh,thanks."
212609,87085,2008-06-12,5,"I was really excited about trying this recipe-and it didn't disappoint. My three year old helped me make it,and with the exception of using homemade sauce followed it to the letter.It took us no time at all.The whole family loved it,even the children,who ate leftovers the next day.Next time I think that I might try mixing the spaghetti with the meat mixture,just so you get an even mix of meat and pasta on your plate.A keeper in this house-many thanks!"
97871,18613,2003-08-07,4,"We enjoyed the taste of this  recipe very much!  I used stew beef, however, and with my large crockpot, the beef was on the verge of being dry (I couldn't get a 1/2 cup of liquid for the stuffing!)...so next time I think I will add a can of water to the beef so it doesn't dry out.

At any rate, a very unique dish that the husband & inlaws enjoyed!"
55729,218794,2011-03-15,4,"Everyone really enjoyed this. I found it because I am always looking to use up that last bit of coffee in the pot (I am tired of throwing it away - coffee is getting expensive!). This time, the cake turned out a bit spongy. This was my fault. I was using a set of measuring spoons that I never use, and discovered while making this that the 1 tsp. was actually 1/2 T. That is NOT the same thing. I figured it out before I got to the vinegar, but the other leavening was wrong. The cake still got devoured, but I am looking forward to making it again with the correct measurements! I used some leftover Marzetti chocolate fruit dip as kind of a frosting glaze, but the cake doesn't really need icing. It's a great snack/dessert without it, and uses ingredients I always have in the house. I know I will be making this often. I used Baker's Joy to grease the pan."
1060667,400088,2017-03-23,5,SO GOOD!! I loved this! The only small changes I made was to use grape tomatoes in place of plum and yellow onion instead of purple (that's what I had). I loved how the avocado gets so creamy and delicious :) :)
518275,32342,2013-02-01,3,"Not a wow factor for us, but still plenty good and enjoyable.  Will definitely make again.  I didn't pound my chicken breast, either, and I'm with another post to try it with a different salsa. I highly recommend you use a salsa you know you like that fits your tastes.  I reheated the leftovers the next night and it was still good.  Easy, too!  Thanks for sharing."
130925,54616,2004-03-12,5,"Tried this recipe, but instead of shank, I used a whole leg.  

Roasted at high temp for 30 minutes.  Then added the Guinness et al.  Also omitted the beef broth.  But substituted one half bottle of Guinness.  (other half goes to the Chef :))

Awesome!!  Thanks for the tips!"
1898398,5478,2012-02-21,2,"I thought this was a disappointment.  Not bad, by any means, but sweeter than I expected or wanted.  The garlic definitely takes a back seat.  Don't think I will make again, or I will adapt it and turn it into an Asian dish with a few modifications."
1934429,27210,2012-05-21,5,my husband loved them!! I made them today!
219291,147615,2007-12-24,5,wonderful shortbread.  i love the subtle flavor... reminds me of Christmas. i have made 2 batches and will be making this recipe over and over.  perfect flavorful shortbread.  thank you.
1195113,278262,2013-05-25,4,Very easy to make. I had to use half milk and half semi-sweet but they still turned out good. Used a small scoop and got  around 33 candies.  Will make again but maybe tweak a little for personal taste.
482376,382156,2012-02-25,5,Great smoothie! I'm always on the lookout for dairy-free smoothie recipes for my daughter. She really enjoyed this. Thanks!
230860,225964,2008-03-01,4,This was a nice simple and lite dish but I think a bit on the plain side... We would have liked a bit more flavor I think.  I did add more cheese than it called for and I still could barely taste the cheese.  I think with some additions it could be great.
728823,29232,2008-02-05,5,"made this for the supper bow, i used chili sauce instead of catsup, for more flavor and meetballs instead of lil smokies, it was the only thing that i had no left overs of!!  i also heated on med-high the grape jelly and the chili sauce togetherto get the clumpyness of the jelly dissolved then put in the crock pot."
1028361,27144,2009-01-12,5,"Even without the glaze, add some vanilla ice cream and it's a crowd pleaser."
115321,39911,2003-12-05,5,"This is a great marinade! I used the London broil cut of meat and thought it was a bit tough, but the marinade made up for that. Next time I'll use a skirt steak or other cut of meat. I think it would make a good marinade for a grilled chicken sandwich too. Thanks!"
174096,410288,2012-08-31,5,This is great.  I used chicken thighs and marinated overnight.  The orange zest and spices add a very nice flavor.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT8
205690,63380,2005-04-07,4,I added extra parmesan cheese and herbs to this and it was even better than I expected.
311003,101610,2012-04-19,5,"I made these wings last night, using Chef#165933's Recipe#109914 in place of the regular soy sauce listed in this recipe.  I added the other marinade ingredients and marinated my wings for 1 1/2 days, turning them every so often.  I cooked them as directed and the wings came out perfectly!  Using Paka's sweet soy sauce in this recipe made the marinade a wonderfully thick sauce -- and when I cooked the wings, the sauce became a dark and rich coating with a taste and texture similar to Peking Duck.  They were fantastic.  Thanks for posting both of these recipes, Paka -- they're superb!"
210473,445240,2015-05-21,5,Just made this.  Followed &quot;itsneverenough&quot;s suggestion and used liquid milk instead of powdered milk and water. Added 1 Tbsp semi-sweet chips and topped the yummy results with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream.  Now I&#039;ve got to get up and make my hubby a second helping!!  This doesn&#039;t rise much so making in a ramekin would work
476538,50515,2008-03-08,5,I made these one night and was super surprised at how good they were and how they really were simliar to the kind you buy at the deli counter. They took a little longer to make but they were so good! I made to many and then put them in a container. I micrwaved them the next day and they were not as crispy but STILL delicious. Thanks!
176167,386755,2011-03-11,5,"LOVE HER!!! I'm not big into chocolate chip pancakes, but this recipe has thousands of variations. I've been using the carbmaster yogurt in flavors. So far I think the lemon is my favorite topped with sugar free syrup. MMMM I also like the vanilla chai with cinnamon and fat free whipped topping. You've got to love a 120 calorie pancake. This calorie counter is off. Thanks for posting it!!!"

482376,152814,2007-08-26,5,Excellent and easy pasta salad. I loved the sauteed zucchini and bell peppers mixed in with the pasta.  I used Barilla Plus pasta and the parmesan cheese. Next time I think I'll let it cool and then add feta cheese - to serve it cold. Great recipe. Thanks!

89831,318635,2008-08-20,5,"this drink should be banned it is so good, I could drink this everday with no problem, I used sweetened pineapple juice as that is all I had, I am going to try this next time using orange juice, what a great drink thanks for sharing Mandy!"
869184,330059,2011-07-17,5,"This is just outstanding! I added fresh tomatoes instead of sundried and omitted the olives - out of preference, instead of olives I added a bit of feta cheese. I also used lemon peel since I did not have preserved lemons. Just love it, flavours, texture and everything just balance so nicely. Thank you for sharing this keeper!"
158079,58111,2009-11-03,0,"Unfortunately, the instructions were not super clear.  I added the oatmeal with the first 6 ingredients because it was not indicated when they should be added.

56112,110022,2005-09-11,4,"This was a really good treat, just a bit on the oily side for me...but good none the less.  Thanks for the great recipe.  "
605535,54570,2008-04-19,5,Made this last night with some T-Bone's and everyone agreed it was just like what we get at the Outback (which we love but hate to spend the money on). Delicious!!! Thanks you so much Carmen!
217328,14927,2005-07-06,5,"I made this tonight for my family,I do not have a crockpot so I cooked it in a roasting tin covered with foil and cooked it on  low heat,It was wonderful very tasty, I shall be cooking this again."
560491,466399,2011-11-19,5,"These are great steaks, the sauce it the best!!  I used some 10 oz bison rib-eye steaks and it was perfect with the sweet sauce.  The only change I made was I used a dark rum instead of bourbon (didn't realize I didn't have any) but is still produced a great sauce.  Made for Everyday Holiday."

479014,113725,2007-08-13,4,"Excellent!!!! I am not lucky with yeast recipes so this allowed me to share a wonderful holiday memory with my kids . Thank You!! I added Almonds, vanilla, and dried cherries, my great Grandma used raisins, rum and almonds so I tried to stay close to that. Not huge on raisins though."
37449,185548,2011-11-17,5,I made a small version of this to try it out and really enjoyed it with crackers. The olives really give it a kick! Thanks!
593993,238741,2008-06-02,4,"I followed the recipie closely, used ingredients from my garden but left out the red pepper (didn't have it) and it was still pretty good.  I think it would be better if I knew what type of bread to serve with that and try it again with the red pepper."
80998,69038,2007-09-07,4,"This is my very first attempt at canning.  I was shocked at how much sugar it called for, but was afraid of ruining the recipe by cutting back to much.  I only ended up using six cups.  It certainly tasted great as I took figer licks.  I did the water bath for 10 minutes.  Now I just need to wait and see how I did.  Thanks for an easy to follow recipe for my first canning project."
724631,39318,2009-04-30,4,"Incredibly easy, and has a distinctive sweet-salty taste that should lend itself well to Recipe #305109 #305109.  It was a lot faster to make than all the stores I checked in vain!  I plan to revisit this review after I have made Recipe #305109.  Made for Asian Forum's Cooking with Sauces Tag."
239758,255140,2008-06-17,5,"Thank you, thank you, thank you for posting this recipe. It reminds me that Zaar should allow 10 stars on very rare occasions. Don't change a thing -- just make a double batch!"
58104,413639,2010-03-07,3,"I`m very sorry for the 3 stars. But we were very disappointed with this. It looked like it was going to be so delish as I prepared it. Prep time was more like 30-45 minutes. Baked in a 9 x 13 pan. My potatoes ended up dark and over cooked, maybe they should have been rinsed and dried before layering to get some of the starch off. The potatoes didn`t state how thin to slice so I sliced thin and layered them with spices as in scallop potatoes. 
I used 8 skinless thighs and they were under-cooked, as was the roasted garlic, too firm to spread. The mushrooms I sliced so they were an even layer across all the potatoes. I did cover with foil as suggested in step #8. The veggies were not eye appealing. I really wanted to enjoy this. Sorry. I did like the panko on the chicken. I know with some adjustments this can be great."
498271,111286,2009-05-28,5,Wow - these are so good!!!  I microwaved my cauliflower in about 1/4 cup water for about 4 minutes and it was perfect.  The herb combination is fantastic and after 20 minutes in the oven the cauliflower was nice and crunchy.  We just loved these and will be making them often - thanks for sharing this keeper!
130663,252288,2008-07-02,5,I just loved these
230579,200288,2007-12-14,4,Doubled this up (not a good idea as had to work twice as hard before it got too cool!) and have made lots of quiches / flans. It certainly makes good crisp pastry. Will use again!
1226586,337926,2010-10-11,5,"Without a doubt, the best pumpkin pie I have ever had....and the most thorough instructions! On the advice of a friend I roasted my pumpkins (poked three big holes in the top and stuck them in the 350 oven for 2 hours) this was a super simple way to cook them, and the seeds and flesh scoop out really easily after - no peeling or chopping or excess water, in fact I had to add water to get the food processor to puree it smooth. Try this recipe you won't be disappointed!"
384210,125138,2017-04-25,5,"Tasty! We made this without the brown sugar because my wife doesn't eat sugar. I'm sure it's better with the sugar, but it was still great without it. We use our smoker almost weekly, and this is the go-to rub."
107135,40260,2006-06-20,5," i like the combination  of textures  and always am looking for canned salmon recipes and this one is easy and cold for hot days  used pink salmon cause its cheaper ,dee"
1316316,324570,2009-07-07,5,"Great! I love the way the lemon compliments the greens in the dish. And I love having two protein bases; garbanzos & tofu. 
Usually it's one or the other, but it this dish to work together beautifully."
461834,157475,2012-06-01,5,"Absolutely delicious bread!!!  I will add another 5 star review and this will be my new pumpkin bread  go to recipe.  I tagged this recipe as my DS's girlfriend loves anything pumpkin, but now I am not sure I want to share any, lol!!!  I made it as written but add chopped pecans to the bread.  I had a slice warm from the oven with some whipped cream cheese and it was to die for!!!  Thanks so much for sharing.  Made for Stars Tag Game."
789516,13619,2011-04-07,5,I halved the recipe and used it with recipe #64149.  It was fantastic.  Thanks for posting.
844554,220656,2010-11-02,5,"This was very good! I used a red bell pepper, 4 cloves garlic, onion and added some defrosted green peas. I also left out the butter. I'll definitely make this one again. Thanks!"
191894,100798,2006-07-07,5,"For those of you that know me, I rarely follow a recipe. I like things easy as can be for daily meals. 

In this recipe, I used a package of angel hair cabbage slaw mixture, to avoid chopping cabbage. I also used fish sticks instead of fillets to cut out, haha, cutting time. 

Other than those changes, I had to add some garlic powder. I can't make anything without it! And, because I like a lot of flavor, I did add a whole bunch of cilantro, probably at least 10 tablespoons or so. I let the slaw set up all day, and even non-slaw eaters gobbled this dish up. Luckily, I had the startings for a second batch of slaw, and was able to make that up for our lunches the next day. I served diced tomatos and jalapenos on the side for the picky eaters.

It was a perfect meal for ninety degree weather! I can't wait to fix it again! Thank you so much!"
936601,215656,2009-04-13,4,"This is a good basic quiche recipe.  I think any veggies or meat combinations can be added to this.  I made one plain - cheeses only, and one with ham and mushrooms.  Both were good.  I think however the baking time and temperature needs to be adjusted.  400F for 1 hour is far to long and too high!  I baked for 10 minutes at 400F then turned the temperature down to 350 for 30 minutes.  Which worked just great.  Thanks for posting Crazycook!  Made for 2009 Spring PAC"
739665,295044,2008-06-09,5,Made this for a family get together and everyone raved about it. I have to now email everyone the recipe. Worth a try and quick to make.
2201460,127614,2012-03-04,5,"love this!! it has great flavor and was very easy to make!! defiantly will make again, great to make on a busy day (or for those full time moms who are also full time students!!)  Delicious, easy, and fast!!"
22015,144378,2006-10-02,5,A very nice thick filling soup.  Nice mix of flavors.  Love the smokey bacon mixed with the veggies.
101732,148951,2006-08-10,5,I made these for my DD and she loved them! I had to use caramel kisses because the store didn't have rolos. They were very good. Thanks!!!
62288,52300,2007-12-28,5,This is a very delicious Pork Roast!
621920,26425,2007-10-27,3,It was good but a little dry for my taste. Next time I will try about half the pasta.
430963,205471,2007-01-15,5,This is a yummy and great recipe. all the slicing and dicing is well worth the time. great for winter!
394085,222653,2007-04-30,5,"This is special.  Easy, quick (in terms of work--but one does need to allow up to 3 or 4 hours before serving to make certain it is ""granitaed"" properly), delicious and different.  I recommend it highly."
29014,12568,2003-12-22,5,"Excellent quick & easy weeknight supper!  I was in the mood for Italian chicken and found this doing a search.  I followed the recipe as posted except to omit one clove of garlic and the seasonings because I had a can of Italian-seasoned tomatoes on hand.  Sprinkled with Parmesan cheese to serve.  Thanks, Tara!"
61660,251453,2009-06-11,5,"I halved the recipe but used 6 ounces of Maine crab meat. I mean, can you have too much crab in a crab dip??  I baked this in a casserole dish at 400 for about 25-30 minutes and finished at a broil to brown the top a bit.  Served it with crackers and tortilla chips (I liked the chips better and DH liked the crackers better).  Needs just a little touch of salt and pepper mixed in or Mrs. Dash.  Made for Las Mistico Magicos Sirenas - ZWT5."
496315,107986,2008-03-31,4,"I'm only giving four stars because the bread did not rise that much, if at all.  However;  I did taste it and thought it tasted very good.  I will definately try to make the bread again with better results.  Thank you for sharing."
1122988,8846,2016-05-15,5,Delicious and easy! Will make again!
2002177893,202833,2018-06-07,5,"Added a layer of Italian sweet sausage I had fried up just before baking it all together. Otherwise followed the recipe pretty close. It turned out great, and everyone in my picky family agreed. Next time ill spice it up with Italian hot sausage!"
206876,107223,2005-04-04,2,I made this and it came out very dry. I didn't think there was enough wet ingredients to make it crunch up. Also it didn't taste that lemony. Like the last reviewer the candied ginger did make it
911826,22116,2009-04-27,5,This has turned into one of my all time favorite soups!
424680,169611,2008-06-13,5,"A great way to liven up green beans! The garlic clove I used was large, & that was to my liking! I also liked the idea of adding some feta, but made it available on the side for those who wanted it (most did)! Thanks for posting your recipe! [Made & reviewed while in Greece on the Zaar World Tour 4]"
128473,198781,2010-04-06,5,"What a great pilaf Paula.  I loved this simple to make dish.  It was full of flavor.  Quick and very easy to make.  It was the perfect accompaniment for my meal.  I served it with pork tenderloin, hush puppies and roasted carrotes.  It blended perfectly with all the other flavors.  I will definitely make this again.  Made for my sweet Pac Girl.  :)"
681090,195384,2008-01-08,5,"Fantastic! Made my cake with glutenfree flour and it was the best GF, egg free, dairy free cake I have ever made.  Kept very well too. Children found the flavours too much as the dates here (Oman) have really intense flavour but my husband and I loved it and pleased to find some grown-up GF, egg/dairy free recipes. If you don't know Omani dates are the best in the world."
125458,97648,2007-04-23,4,"This was very good - lovely mild garlic flavor with the gruyere (I did throw in the whole clove). But it is what it says it is, ie. it does taste ""light"". Don't be looking for a creamy consistency if you make this. We really liked it, but I think next time I'll follow Gay's lead and use whole milk and perhaps increase the cheese a tad. It scores real high on flavor and ease of preparation."
252570,174198,2009-11-10,5,Fantastic ! And so easy. All ingredients on hand- chicken tasted wonderful. The steak seasoning gives it a little bite. Thanks for posting
402798,69111,2006-12-08,5,wonderful...cant wait to share it with my friends and family
355582,200296,2007-02-22,5,"My entire family is in love with this chicken.  My D.H. says it's the only chicken he looks forward to eating.  It has wonderful flavor, and is deliciously moist!  Thanks for posting!"
2002271840,154740,2018-09-10,2,I made it based on the recipe. Way too much rice. Not enough cabbage &amp; not enough ground turkey &amp; on the sweet side. I'll make it again however I'd tweak everything stated above.
2001412887,517511,2017-03-02,0,It turned out HORRIBLE!! I actually stinked up my whole house doing this recipe. I usually (not to brag) am a fabulous baker. Any tips to help me improve this recipe?
1133190,18599,2010-03-13,4,"This soup was good but kind of time consuming to make.  For the record, my husband loved it.  I think using at least 1 cup of chicken stock in place of a cup of the half and half would add some flavor to the soup.  I'll try that next time if I make it again."
422893,96991,2007-08-08,4,"I did a half batch of this to be my brekky for a few days, I used rye bread and also sprinkled some frozen mixed berries on before cooking. Reheated for brekky with a drizzle of maple syrup & some vanilla yoghurt, this was really tasty. A great simple & delicious breakfast, thanks!"
35488,348196,2009-04-12,5,"Wonderful salad made for Easter this year - can't believe how much it ended up making....I used 2 large 4 qt bowls, and ended up doubling the dressing cause they're such flat bowls, not enough to cover the tops of both.  Made for spring PAC 2009.  Will be made often again and again!"
181661,60955,2006-08-01,4,"pretty bland, but not bad at all when you add some salt/pepper/cayenne/tobasco sauce to taste. the texture is great! thanks for the healthy, protein-packed alternative."
385999,198077,2008-12-22,4,"I made these for Chanukah for our lunch. I added some zucchini and squash to mine besides the potatoes to give them some color. They were very good, but a bit bland.  They stuck to my my baking tray.  Next time I'll use a little spray oil to make sure this doesn't happen again. I think next time I'll use a bit more garlic and onion in them as well."
255338,94133,2007-12-02,5,"This was LOVED by all my children. I used chicken breast, but other than that, followed the recipe faithfully. Thank you so much for sharing."
2194936,250326,2012-02-26,5,"This recipe is quite good!<br/><br/>I modified by using 1 whole egg   3 whites, and liquid stevia instead of Splenda. I also used Energy brown rice flour since I was out of soy flour. The recipe worked out just fine....very good recipe - thanks!"
198580,19725,2005-03-10,4,"This was a good recipe, but didn't knock our socks off.  Could have been because I used Pepsi vice Coke, but I'm not sure.  The sauce just tasted like Ketchup and Mustard mixed together, but that's okay...cuz I like both of them.  I will likely make again for a midweek family dinner, but don't think I'll be breaking this out to impress our friends.  It was fun to pour a soda into my food, though."
41793,37455,2003-05-30,5,Awesome pizza crust... can't make enough of it in our house... I sometimes just plaster it with garlic butter and bake as normal... makes a wonderful garlic bread!
1693053,137530,2010-09-30,0,"I made this with chicken thighs, and followed the recipe. So yummy, really really liked it! My husband said it was the best chicken dish we have made so far in our slow cooker. I love chick peas so will make again, and we tried couscous for the first time as well !"
573577,303490,2008-05-16,5,I was looking for a way to jazz up my morning oatmeal and this is it!! I just made this today and it was a great change. Adding the walnuts makes it an excellent way to incorporate some protin too. My two and a half year old loves it as well. Thanks for the needed change!
222139,6737,2006-04-29,5,"This came out so good! Everybody that tried it could not believe how good it was. Thanks to Pick A chef I made this recipe other wise I would have passed this recipe by.  This is so easy to make.  You should try it first to see whether or not you need to increase the apples, nuts and cheddar depending on your tasts.  One Batch gone and another one on its way this weekend... 10 STARS easily!"
29655,6583,2002-06-06,5,I didn't change a thing and it was a hit with the whole family.  This dish will be seen again when we want something other than American food as this has somewhat of a Moroccan flair.  Quite delicious!
55729,83772,2012-01-11,3,"I made 2 of these at once. That is a lot of lemon juice to squeeze! It was easy to do, but I personally thought the flavor was a little *too* subtle. Very moist for chicken that hasn't been brined, so good to make in a pinch. I think I will try other recipes next time, though. I threw out one of the whole lemons, but then realized I could probably still use the juice in cooked recipes, so I saved the rest."
532289,109177,2010-09-08,5,"These are absolutely amazing.  I am so happy I decided to try this recipe.  I was concerned at first as my dough was extremely crumbly.  (It may be the weather here, the batch of snickerdoodles I made failed and that has never happened before).  I rolled them into balls, baked and filled with strawberry jam.  I agree with Krista.  I had never made thumbprint cookies before but I won't be looking for a different recipe.  Thanks for sharing."
2001883482,64015,2017-12-23,0,They turned out awesome
132383,61946,2009-02-22,5,"I think my husband was hesitant about this recipe because of the ""balsamic.""  However, he really loved the light sauce this produces.  We doubled the sauce since we were serving over noodles.  What I really loved is that this just didn't taste like hamburger.  Thanks so much!"
1237853,174723,2009-04-14,4,"These turned out great. The texture is scrumptious! I used prunes and some whole wheat flour (1 cup whole wheat flour + 2 cups all purpose flour). I also had a little of the glaze left over after coating the muffin tins, so i brushed it on top of the muffins about 5 min before they came out of the oven. The glaze really makes these resemble Mimi's muffins and keeps them super moist. I used a silicon muffin pan and all of the muffins came out no problem."
536761,178295,2013-02-13,5,Amazing and easy pie! Taste just like Lemon Pie and no one knew that it was yellow squash. Thanks for a great recipe!
35900,8509,2002-04-10,4,"Very tender, and I loved the flavor from the beer although my husband found it 
a bit strong. I will definitely make this recipe again and plan to try some beef bouillon
w/worcestershire sauce for part of the beer."
122541,643,2008-09-21,5,"This recipe has very good flavor combinations. Although I didn't follow it exactly the flavor combinations are fantastic.

I had some pre-cooked chicken and canned stewed tomatoes. 

I sauteed the squash, garlic, and threw the rosemary in too, then added the tomatos, lime zest and lime juice and cubed cooked chicken, covered and put in oven for 20 minutes. Thickened the sauce with a little flour. 

Just zest a lime with a zester- don't fuss with the matchstick cuts - we did the matchsticks and I believe a zester would be better.

Again the flavors were fantastic - good basis for pork chops too."
306797,236060,2008-06-18,4,"This was a nice meal to have ready when we got home tonight.  We don't get Rotel tomatoes & I didn't realise it had chilies in it until just now, so will add chili next time.  My crockpot is a little small & I had no room for corn or lima beans.  Still a lovely meal.  Thanks Vicki for sharing.  Made for ZWT4"
526843,12210,2010-12-27,5,"Nice, easy pie.  Made this for Thanksgiving, using a store-bought pie crust, and it was done in 5 minutes (well, not counting the chilling time).  Tasted great, and was gone before the night was up- can't ask for much more than that!"
95743,68812,2005-07-30,5,Sweet and slightly spicy rub that does a good job of covering up the flavor of the salmon.  Handy if you're not crazy about salmon but want to get more of it in your diet. I'd like to emphasize the warning about burning the sugar - it's very touchy.  Watch closely as recommended.
2002240626,255145,2018-08-06,5,"My pickles are working hard....fermenting! I can't wait to taste these bad boys! I have already picked over 100 cucumbers from my garden and made both these as well as 2 batches bread and butter pickles. PLEASE read this recipe carefully as it gives all the information in the recipe about skimming the scum and moldy bits from the brine....also NO WHERE in this recipe does it call for CLOVES...however, what it does call for is cloves of GARLIC!"
676251,216778,2010-07-11,4,Great summer meal!
350255,228909,2008-05-27,5,"I made these thighs along with chicken breast on bone for Memorial Day and I added lime juice, sliced onions and garlic (3 cloves).  I just ate the last piece today, it is one of the best recipes that I have for barbecue chicken.  Thanks."
399711,15392,2010-07-08,5,surprisingly good for so few ingredients. I  used vegetarian chorizo and added red pepper flake and texas pete instead of tabasco. comfort food.
294705,107142,2006-07-08,5,Very good !!
2883992,206581,2013-06-30,5,Wonderful recipe!! Better than Olive Garden!
11009,53876,2003-08-16,5,ooooh Barb! I've been wanting the recipe to this ever since my first trip to Carrabba's. They say they make this fresh everyday for when they open up at 3pm. I could make a meal out of this and nothing more.
98165,28148,2009-01-07,5,These were pretty good.  I used salsa instead of the picante and they turned out very yummy.  I would think you could do all kinds of variations with this.  Very good recipe.
262357,155359,2006-09-28,5,"I had left-over Puerto Rican Style Pork Roast #56651 so I didn't use this roast pork recipe but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  My husband had eaten Cuban Sandwiches at the Columbia Restaurant in Tampa and he thought these were just as good.  They use salami also but he didn't think it was missed.  We used mustard only and buttered the outside of the bread.  I grilled them on my George Foreman Grill, pressing down hard to flatten and melt everything together.  How can you go wrong with pork, ham, swiss cheese and dill pickles on Cuban Bread!"
86764,91624,2006-02-01,5,"This was deeeelish!  I had some coconut milk leftover from another recipe in the back of my fridge and it was CRYING OUT to be used!  I did have to cut the recipe in half (which didn't effect anything but the quantity of my ice cream) because my little churn only makes a pint.  I didn't have anything but half-n-half, but it worked fine.  After it froze most of the way, I stuck it back in the freezer to firm up a bit more.  Absolutely a tropical treat!  Thanks so much for posting a great recipe!  I will definately be using this again!"
39835,84838,2004-11-05,4,"These are wonderful for a late supper with fried rice. The leftovers are also great frozen and heated up for lunches. Another plus for these spring rolls is they use a bit less oil than other egg roll recipes, so they seem a bit healthier than the deep fried versions. Thanks for sharing!"
286566,373272,2010-12-09,5,"A wonderful sweet and tangy flavour and a word of advice if you are like us and like to eat your drumsticks with your hands make sure you have finger bowls and napkins handy.  I decided to bake them in the oven at 175C fan forced oven for 50 minutes, turning them every 15 minutes.  The 9 drumsticks just fitted into my baking dish and though it didn't get as thick as it would with grilling/broiling method you have a wonderful sauce to put over your rice.  Thank you Brookelynne26, madee for Photo Tag.  UPDATE - there was one drumstick left over which I have just devoured as a late night snack - the DH is on night shift and the DM and DS had gone to bed and well I was feeling hungry and I remembered this lone drumstick that had been left over - well it was absolutely delicious, not as sticky but oh the flavours had just developed and could I say even better - fully recommend for making ahead for a picnic or lunch boxes with a nice salad."
422893,19160,2007-07-01,5,I needed some cajun spice & only noticed at the last minute that I'd run out of store bought so threw this together. Thanks for saving my meal plans. Made for ZWT III.
1949949,236240,2011-07-07,5,"It's been a while since I've lived near an Eat N' Park, but these are just like the muffins I loved!"
18207,4753,2001-09-18,4,This recipe is very easy and very delicious. I found it to  be rich and filling. I made as a side with ribs.
29196,30858,2003-08-16,5,"I was a bit doubtful about this soup (no meat, so simple) but was very, very suprised. It is so full of flavour its unbelievable. I had red lentils needing to be used, and although they seemed to be cooked sooner than the 1 1/2 hours stated, I continued to let the soup simmer and develop more flavour. Like Charishma said, it didn't need salt, but plenty of black pepper and the red wine vinegar just added that final kick!"
80353,73844,2004-04-25,5,"Really a super finger food.  I served these with drinks at a dinner party, and everyone loved them!  Loved the caramelized onions with the brie, and the attractive appearance.  Thank you!"
853344,42367,2009-02-25,5,"I made these cupcakes for my daughter's  2nd birthday and everyone raved about them! They are delicious and moist. The cream cheese ""surprise"" is wonderful. I had a lot of the cream cheese mixture left over and filled two cupcake tins with it. They made good mini cheesecakes :)
I will be using this recipe over and over, thanks for sharing it!"
174096,378030,2009-07-10,5,Yummy!  Nice bite from the red pepper and a great blend of flavors.  I love the addition of the zucchini.  Thanks for sharing!
253241,60551,2005-11-09,4,Very good taste! I have been looking for a match to the oatmeal coconut cookie that was my fav as a kid. This is as close as I have been able to make. I had started mixing before I realized I only had 1/4 cup of coconut so I just increased the oatmeal and they still turned out well. I will be sure to stock up on coconut and try this recipe again soon. Thanks!
808027,16666,2010-05-19,5,"This is a fabulous recipe.  It packs an amazing amount of flavor, especially given its simplicity.  It also made the entire house smell incredible while cooking!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!!  I did make just a few changes...added 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon cumin and used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, as it's all I had.  Didn't need the salt due to the canned tomatoes.  PERFECTION on a plate.  And it's SO HEALTHY.  What more can you ask for?"
2000856655,74275,2016-02-05,5,"Absolutely LOVED IT!!  I cooked my potatoes in chicken broth instead of water. As it cooked, I added 1/2 cup of onion and 1 garlic clove into the thickened boiling broth. When it was almost finish i threw in 1 cup of chopped thick crispy bacon(as it sit in the soup it will soften some), Milk instead of half &amp; half, 1/3 cup of sauteed mushrooms and 1/4  cup of green onions. Everyone Loved it! I made a nice big pot, everyone had seconds and still have leftovers.This is not my last time making this. 
  Thank you for sharing this!"
237123,115501,2005-12-10,0,"Thanks for this recipe, Grease!  I used it as a guide to make a vegetarian version, which turned out great.  I decided that since I changed the recipe so much, I could not actually rate it.  But if my results are any indication, I am sure that this recipe is great!  I am planning on posting my vegetarian version- giving you credit, of course!  "
89549,286022,2008-03-06,5,"This was delicious. I used dried fruit. I was not sure! I used dried cranberries instead of the cherries, and dried pears instead of the golden raisins. I also used only 1/2 cup of sugar. I served a large spoonful with a dollop of plain yogurt sweetened with honey, and a splash of rose water. Thanks for posting this recipe. I love middle eastern dishes!"
1418597,134501,2009-11-24,5,Short and sweet...  Easy to make with results that suggest you have been slaving for hours!  Thanks for the great recipe!
628076,243454,2009-10-27,5,"We had this a couple of ways ... one as written and then one with strawberries, raspberries and with currant jelly mixed in. All were great!"
5060,55974,2003-03-12,5,"Excellent bread machine bread Barb!!  DH made it this afternoon and when I walked into the house I couldn't wait to try it , it smelled soooo good!!He said to tell you the directions were great, very easy to follow, he had no problems.  the taste is outstanding , slightly sweet, wonderful still warm with a little butter. We will be making this one again, thanks for sharing."
405126,83806,2008-02-21,5,wonderful! we halved the recipe and it still came out great! ill have to make up an excuse to envite people over to try it
199848,99767,2009-03-09,5,"Very simple, yet a nice, deep flavor.  I chose Dijon mustard for the mustard and it was an excellent choice.  I used unsalted butter, so I did add a bit of salt to the glaze.  This was a fabulous side to Sandylee's  Recipe #217449.  Thanx for sharing.  I highly recommend these for a quick but not boring side dish."
124030,51349,2005-03-06,5,"This is a very popular salad at church potlucks that I have attended.  Goes together easy, and the flavor is wonderful.  If you do have leftovers, the lettuce tends to go limp if it is left very long.  Never had that problem here though."
226462,106697,2008-01-29,4,"I made this because it sounded interesting! And that it is, in a good way!  I cut the recipe in half and made as posted. I like that it still has the crunch of the onion and pickle just like 'real potato salad'. Made for 2008 Cookbook Tag."
25455,146399,2007-01-26,0,"My copy of this recipe read 4 ""heaping"" tablespoons cocoa.  Just thought I would mention that here rather than post a near duplicate recipe."

164368,142662,2007-12-01,4,"My family enjoyed this soup.  My only complaint was that the cream cheese never seemed to completely incorporate itself into the soup.  It looked a little ""grainy"".  It didn't affect the taste at all, just the texture (that's why only 4 stars).  That being said the flavour of this soup gets better & better with age.  The leftovers kept getting yummier! thanks for the recipe!"
1366254,52366,2010-03-20,5,perfectly cooked and seasoned! very tender and delicous
168771,223633,2008-12-31,5,My entire family at one time or another worked at the Red Apple Inn on Eden Isle.  This was the specialty of the house and we all love it.  Caroline continues to bring my favorite recipes from Arkansas to Zaar and I'm glad she does.  This rocks!
1022504,386724,2011-09-24,5,"So yummy! I had Miracle Rice on hand (still made of Shiratake) and used one 8oz bag for my husband and I. I added a little salt and pepper to taste, and one thing great about this recipe is that you can throw just about any amount of broccoli and ham in and it comes out delicious. Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make this again."
62043,22420,2003-08-12,5,"Wonderful, traditional recipe. I reduced the eggs to 2, just our personal preference. Served on a lettuce leaf, garnished with cherry tomatos, and alongside some challah for shmearing... My guests just loved it. Thanks Mirj"
1122311,128566,2009-05-12,5,"Very pleasing and family-friendly; adaptable to any vegetables you have on hand. I used just a top crust and omitted the half & half to make this dish a bit lighter in the fat department. ... and for the saute, I used part butter, part canola oil. Tasty and fragrant."
1802849661,55678,2015-08-13,5,"We are so obsessed with sweet potatoes at the moment! Baked is just the best way to eat them, I served ours with some oven baked salmon and it&#039;s a new favourite here, delicious!"
126435,121897,2008-08-11,5,"WONDERFUL! My in-laws gave us a bakers dozen corn from their garden, and I decided to try it this way since my DH was home and REFUSES to eat corn on the cob in the microwave. This corn was so tender, and tasted more fresh than any corn I've ever had! And I have had corn that was pulled from the stalk, brought into the house, and cooked immediately that didn't taste this fresh! It just truly wakes up all of the natural flavors of the corn. Served with fresh sauteed zucchini and Recipe#168529. This will be my method of making corn on the stove from now on! Thanks for sharing!"
156653,124949,2005-08-22,4,"These cookies were yummy. I made sure to keep a close watch on the temprature and baking time, and mine did not burn, however, I had a really hard time with them sticking and falling apart. They are DEFINATELY soft! Thats for sure. Either way, the taste was very rich and delicious. Thank you for this recipe homegirl!"
474346,154109,2007-04-18,5,looks good!
208829,127220,2005-07-06,4,"I used regular oregano and I would probably use a little less garlic next time. Otherwise, a great salad!"
13593,148234,2005-12-26,5,"Delicious and very easy to prepare and eat.  I made this a week or so before Christmas and forgot to review.  I enjoyed cooking with Guiness and enjoyed the leftovers, both brisket and Guiness (I had to buy a 6-bottle pack because I could not find a single big bottle of Guiness).  The gravy is delicious and it flavors the brisket nicely.  Great recipe for the ""meat and potato"" eaters.  Thanks for sharing.   "
344231,370563,2009-05-14,5,Wow!  What a fantastic relish!!  This has a nice balance of sweet and sour with some lovely hints of curry and cayenne - but is not very spicy.  Hubby loves it so much it will likely become a regular at our house.  Made for ZWT5.  Thanks for such a yummy relish recipe.  (-:
147109,12522,2008-09-19,4,"This was good, but just had too much of a sweet flavor to me. It was very crunchy, but I cringed using all that butter, so if I make it again I will cut back on the butter and maybe not use sweet butter, or add some garlic or ranch seasonoing to the crackers instead.  Overall a good recipe, but we will tweek it to our tastes. Thanks!"
2729186,447551,2013-03-12,4,This was wonderful.  I made it for a friend who has a family member in the hospital and no time to cook.  They loved it...as did we.  Two things though: I only used 2 1/2 t of dill and it was plenty!  And it was rather pricey to make although it does serve more than 8.
18745,19174,2005-12-15,5,This was very easy to prepare and very tasty.  The only changes I made were to add more spices and I didn't have enought potatoes left over so I chopped up the potatoes from a can of canned potatoes and instead of using canned milk I used left over gravy.  It was very good.  Thanks for posting!  
498716,145125,2012-03-13,5,"fantastic, i'm never using anything else"
333017,71615,2006-07-22,5,"I was really suprised at how good this marinade was, thinking that the cinnamon would overpowder the taste.  I marinated skinless thicken thighs for about 4 hours and they came out quite tender and flavourful.  I did not have to adjust this recipe at all.  This is a treasure.  Thanks for sharing!!"
356850,57007,2007-02-01,5,My son loved these cookies. They are now one of his two favorites. The are better the second day. I doubled all extract amounts and doubled the frosting.I mostly liked the texture of the cookies. They are soft and chewy.
1802535091,33170,2016-02-26,0,"I am going to give this a 4. The basic recipe is really good. REALLY GOOD! But...

What I did the second time was this. I substituted the cinnamon with allspice. I also used Chipotle Chile spice.  Since the mix was a bit thick before, I squeezed in a half a lime, and added between 1/8th, &amp; 1/4 cup of beer. I wanted something that flowed a bit better so I could baste while grilling. I also grilled on a little Smokey Joe. Now, this still ain&#039;t a &quot;jerk&quot;, like the jerk said. But whoa!"
227607,39369,2008-01-06,5,I just LOVED this!!!! I had some sliced portobello mushrooms and found myself needing some cream of mushroom soup but did not have any in the house.  I did not think it was going to work but tried it anyway since I had everything I needed in the house.  I did have to add some more flour to get it thick enough and I added a little garlic when sauteing the mushrooms.  I also used milk.  Wow!!! It worked wonderfully for the recipe I needed it for and was great on its own too.  I don't think I will have to buy cream of mush soup again.  It was soo easy to make.
67656,318647,2008-08-26,5,Always on the lookout for new ways to serve vegetables and this instantly caught my eye.  Had not considered rosemary as an accompaniment to this combination of vegetables but it was a wonderful marriage.  In my dish I used fresh as it is now growing rather abundantly.  My only quibble with this dish was the vegetables needed different cooking times.  My asparagus were just perfect crisp but tender at the end of the stated roasting time while the carrots were still to the raw side.  I ended up cooking them an additional 10 minutes.  I would suggest starting them first adding the asparagus and scallions later or cutting them in half lengthwise to reduce their cooking time.  Thank you so much for a side which will become a staple when asparagus is n season. Made for Photo Tag.
1800092218,260781,2013-10-01,4,"I&#039;m no cook but I do very occasionally bake so I thought I&#039;d give these a try and they came out just fine. Another review said it was too hard to mix but using a hand blender worked just fine. Next time I would use a spice cake mix instead of yellow cake and add pumpkin pie spice. They&#039;re not super sweet so I think a vanilla glaze would be good too. Otherwise they&#039;re pretty tasty and, of course, super easy."
2001827848,133448,2017-11-27,4,I added a little more butter because sauce was to liquidy but besides that...Awes9me considering cooking for a family of five
2489964,337236,2012-11-09,3,"I have been using this recipe for about 7-8 years now.  I sprinkle garlic powder on the inside and outside, with a little pepper, and mimize the salt.  The white meat always comes out perfect and it has a delicious flavor.  HOWEVER, I have yet to have the dark meat cook through.  And it's not just the legs, it's the meat on the thighs as well.  So returning the legs to the oven doesn't solve the problem- we have to slice off all the white meat, then put the carcass back in or slice the raw dark meat and put it in on a cookie sheet, which dries it out.  The last 2 years, we've had meat thermometer malfunctions.  This year, I bought 2 new ones- a leave-in and an instant read.  My plan is to try this process one last time (if my mother-in-law doesn't revolt), putting the leave-in thermometer in the thigh instead of the breast (and check the breast with the instant read).  I need to do a big turkey this year, so I really don't want to have to cook it for 5-6 hours.  If anyone has suggestions on the dark meat, please post them!"
750295,25885,2008-02-03,5,"This is the only recipe I will ever use it uses about 6 bananas about twice the amount of most recipes. It yeilds a very moist and flavorful bread. I usually add a cup of chopped walnuts to mine, but that is totally optional."
486725,352626,2013-12-03,4,"Flavor is great, but this is a 10 napkin (literally) meal! I took the advice of another reviewer and left the chutney off. I put more basil in the mayo, but probably could have put way more lemon too. Nice change of pace from your normal hot dog."
38094,36653,2002-08-15,4,"Served this for lunch today and enjoyed it.  Made it with peaches, vanilla no-fat yogurt and a smidgen of almond extract instead of vanilla. Because I used sweet yogurt I halved the sugar.  I think it will make a good breakfast tomorrow. I like sweet treats that don't make me feel guilty!"
26278,44729,2004-12-27,5,This simple recipe is a keeper!! Served this for dessert at Christmas dinner with fresh whipped cream.  It was a great hit.  Thanks for posting!! =)
137146,110683,2010-03-13,5,"I have tried a dozen waffle recipes, and they were all regected by my picky family.  This recipe is the one they loved.  Even my pickiest eater gave it a YUM.  The only recipe I will use from now on.  It saved my waffle maker from the trash.  Thank you so much."
1130733,406682,2010-03-16,5,the flavors are amazing!!! Thanks for sharing!
27643,37665,2007-04-14,5,Great recipe! Easy to make and tastes wonderful. I used the regular soup also. And I had Pepperidge Farms stuffing on hand and it worked really well. We loved the flavor of this dish.  I will definitely save this one. Thanks!
166263,49232,2004-10-09,5,"Thank you, Ridgely for posting this recipe!  I accidentally forgot to add the baking powder but it still turned out wonderful. Thanks again -- this one is a keeper!"
85018,36369,2003-07-08,5,"Made this for the residents at the assisted living facility for the elderly for whom I cook  part-time.  They absolutely loved it.  Most asked question-when can we have it again?  I whipped this up when I got into work in the morning and we had it for dessert at dinner(noon). Really great! Everything I look for in a dessert for work-taste,originality,ease of preparation,and made with ordinary on-hand ingredients!  Thanx, Melanie!"
185285,134826,2006-11-27,5,"What a great 'quick sourdough' recipe when I need it! I was looking (frantically) for something to change up my Turkey Sandwich leftovers, and this did the trick! I had to add 1 tsp of active yeast to get a rise in time for dinner.  This was great! For my mixed herbs, I used some fresh thyme and powdered onion.  With my turkey, I did a bit of roasted garlic mayo and cracked pepper.  Loved it!"
1306775,200140,2009-06-25,5,"Delicious! 
Substitute Panko for the breadcrumbs and ditch the cheddar cheese (they are so good you really don't even need it) to cut the calories pretty much in half. 
by my calculations you get then, for one burger,
9 g fat
53 g cholesterol
150mg sodium
37g carb
4.5g fiber
6g protein

and this is using the hamburger buns... eat it on a bed of lettuce to cut even more calories =D
And idk if the optional ingredients are included in the nutrition... so this is actually a very low calorie meal.
all in all, delicious! I put honey mustard, ketchup and hummus on mine (chickpea bonanza i guess!) and ate it on a bed of mesclun"
193516,85839,2005-05-02,5,"These brownies are the best very low-fat brownies I have ever tasted!!  I can't believe I waited so long to make these.  Usually low-fat brownies are dry and cake like, or use WAY too much sugar.  I made this recipe as is...well I omitted the walnuts.  They are very moist and have just the right sweetness and chocolate flavour. The blueberries add a succulent sweet twist.  These deserve way more than 5 stars and will be made again and again... Thank you, Thank you Jessi Garcia!!!!!  "
124249,53957,2005-11-13,4,"I was a little worried when I was mixing this since it had a little more liquid than my old standby meatloaf but it cooked up okay.  I let it stand a few minutes before I put it in the baking dish and it firmed up a litte. The meatloaf was nice and moist.  The leftovers made a pretty good sandwich.

Thanks Tweeky.

94087,81909,2006-07-06,5,These were very popular with my guests Suzy.  The only problem was they broke very easily.  Maybe I will use a smaller pan next time so they will be a little thicker.  I also put some very finely chopped bacon on top before cooking.  I’ll try the pesto you suggested next time.  Thanks for an appetizer that is a little different.  
431813,217075,2008-04-26,5,"Very tasty, simple dip.  We added the suggested hot sauce and loved this with fresh veggies!  Thanks ChrisD!  Made for PAC Spring 2008."
2222649,291552,2014-12-22,2,"This recipe was working great until i got to the chocolate and marshmallows.  I put them in and tried mixing in as best as possible.  After not getting anywhere, I put it back on the heat and warmed it up a little to mix it in.  At the point, it looked AMAZING and i couldn&#039;t wait.  I then made my way to the pan and realized, THE VANILLA! So I put it back on the stove and put the vanilla in the pan.  That was the worst mistake ever.  It looks like slop now.  It&#039;s not soaking in and it looks all grainy.  I&#039;m rating it 2 stars for now, but I could change it later depending on how it tastes.  I am so bummed right now, but I hope it tastes good in about 30 minutes.  We shall see...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**Update** After letting it sit for about an hour in the fridge, it&#039;s as hard as a rock and just tastes like a chocolate bar.  I followed the recipe to a T, but messed up on the vanilla part.  I doubt that one piece would have affected it that much though."
791416,110604,2008-11-23,4,"This was quite a good cake! It was moist and lemony... my only regret is from all the pre-mixed stuff (pudding, cake mix) it tasted slightly chemically. But no matter, everyone enjoyed it!"
429976,194889,2007-12-18,5,"Delicious! My 3 year old gobbled up 2 bowls, my husband and I loved it and my picky 7 year old ate his whole bowl (but only rated it 2.5). I added a sweet potato that needed to be used up, used regular cheddar and skim milk and added about a teaspoon of garlic. We used a whole t. of tumeric. Great recipe!"
2117408,133109,2012-03-02,5,"This was a really great recipe.  I was worried the cauliflower would turn to mush after cooking so long, but it turned out perfectly. I often find vegetarian meals lack some flavour, but not the case in this dish.  Can't wait to have the leftovers tonight!"
35140,112788,2005-03-15,5,"I made this exactly by the recipe.  Next time, I might cut down a tad on the salt.  This was delicious - everyone really loved it - and it could be a meal or a side dish.  Definitely on the repeat list in my house.  Thanks for posting."
1518415,87782,2010-01-28,5,"Great. I made these french fry style with peels on so I could serve with turkey drummies for our ""finger food nite."" I par boiled them to cut down oven time. Added grated parmesan cheese and left off the lemon & oregon this time. Will do that next time with a different meal. They were great dipped in ketchup!"
164914,159877,2010-01-25,5,"This recipe seriously needs to add 1/4 cup of water to it!!!  I loved this recipe and when i used my hand blender and added 1/4 cup of water it came out GREAT!!!  This recipe is perfect for a spinach salad dressing!  Don't forget the water... otherwise it's more a dip then a dressing which would be delish... but with the water added... it's the perfect salad dressing!  thanks for sharing... yummy, yummy, yummy!!!"

2471534,386803,2012-10-28,5,"Wow! This lamb was sooo good. I  bought lamb ribs on a whim and had no clue what to do with it. I really like the Outback lamb so I looked it up and found this recipe. It turned out exactly like Outback, if not better. The only thing I did differently was I seasoned the lamb the night before I cooked it. I was also out of marjoram and rosemary but it wasn't a problem. Thank you so much for posting!"
431716,61849,2007-09-18,5,This is a great recipe!! I used half sour cream & half fat free yogurt as our store refuses to carry low fat sour cream. Makes me crazy :) I also left the seeds in as I was using little crisp cukes fresh from the garden. Next time I will try adding some red onion but they were great as is. Thanks for a yummy recipe Kelly!!
779751,308984,2008-06-27,5,"I can't say enough about this dish!  The taste is so fresh; the presentation is simple, yet beautiful enough for an elegant dinner party.  Thank you...we love it!"
210184,98246,2008-06-06,5,"YUM! Neither my husband or I are big on most veggies, or really like a lot of 'em for that matter, but this recipe had us fighting over the leftovers! We used a mixture of green peppers, onions, zucchini, mushrooms, and carrots. I'd never really tried zucchini before, but I LOVED it in this recipe. I can't wait to try it with more vegetables.
EDIT: This recipe tastes great with the onion soup mix, as well. I added a little garlic powder and it was good to go!"

1028794,87075,2009-12-18,5,"Oh. My.  I don't really even know where to begin!  First of all, I'm Irish and married to an Irish-American from the Pacific Northwest--neither of us had ever even *heard* of a loosemeat sandwich prior to my stumbling upon this recipe.  Plantfreek's description and the feedback from those who've tried the recipe made it irresistible, though, and I gave it a shot last night.  I made it exactly as written (complete with cast iron skillet) and even did up a batch of Plantfreek's hamburger buns (another incredible recipe!) just to see how it was supposed to taste when done 'properly'.  WOW.  My husband raved as I've rarely heard him go on about any dish, and I fell in love with the sandwiches, too.  As others have said, it's extremely difficult to believe that so few ingredients can combine into such rich flavours!  It's supremely easy and quick, as well, and--though initially sceptical about the seasonings--I wouldn't change a thing.  This will be part of our menu repertoire in perpetuity.  Thanks so much for posting!"
2001630370,40993,2017-07-17,0,I was wondering if anyone ever used fruit cocktail with extra cherries and Brandy when making this starter and this cake. I had a recipe similar to this one and it called for the fruit cocktail. Also called for Brandy it was so good.
93446,185748,2010-11-06,0,"We had this a recent Zaar get-together, baked by the chef herself.  What an absolutely delicious pie!  I can still taste its lusciousness in my mind!  I like that it isn't really sweet as I usually cut the sugar in my baked goods in half.  It would be awesome topped with whipped cream or a really good vanilla ice cream (or frozen yogurt for me.)  Edited on November 6, 2010 - I finally got around to making this pie myself and it is as delicious as Elly's!  I found that I didn't have quite enough peaches so added frozen mango to make up the difference and it was quite delightful."
1803732796,272179,2015-02-01,1,"I was extremely confused by this recipe. In the description it says bake for 25 mins, but in the actual recipe it says bake for 45 minutes. It says to put the pasta dry and bake the other stuff on top. The pasta was still raw and crunchy. It has good flavors, and would be good if the recipe was written correctly. We found it inedible, we had to order pizza. :("
200862,131471,2007-05-19,5,"Wow, this was gooood!!! But I had a problem here, of my own making. This meant I could either go with no stars, or 5 stars!! The story is: I had eaten a classic Quiche Lorraine in the restaurant La Table Lorraine in the city of Nancy, France, in the province of Lorraine! (I thought that was quite an achievement!) It was so fabulous that ever since that was my standard!! VERY unfair, as there are hundreds of variations!! This one was stunning. The only ""fault"" was mine. I forgot to buy cream, so I used a carton (1 cup) of thick, firm creme fraiche plus 1 cup of fullcream milk. I decided that might just add up to 2 cups whipping cream. Otherwise, I did not change a single thing -- I love puff pastry anyway. The quiche was gorgeous. I do feel my subbing of the cream might have made a difference, but this recipe works so well, it's really great!! I used perhaps more nutmeg and black pepper than specified -- at least 1/2 teaspoon each, or more. I did not add garlic, because Quiche Lorraine is quite delicate in taste. The consistency was like a custard almost threatening to fall apart -- perfect, light, rich.
So? How can I give Kittencal, one of the best cooks on Zaar, less than 5 stars for this one?? (I fear tomorrow .... there will be quite a lot left over and I am known for eating cold leftovers for breakfast, and this is fattening ...!!) Sorry, no picture this time, as a storm is approaching and it was already dark when it came out of the oven!!"
791416,211568,2011-01-22,5,"These were delicious! I had some frozen potato cubes in the freezer I wanted to use up, and they were perfect! I didn't make the syrup because I wanted to freeze the leftover pancakes and I wasn't sure that the syrup would last a week. But the pancakes themself had perfect texture and colour, and I owuld definitely make them again without hesitation."

1710338,155480,2011-02-13,4,"I really liked the cookies! I did tweek it a little. I did not use the 1/4 cup baking cocoa or the 2 tablespoons shortening, divided. <br/>Basically, I made the standard cut out dough, which I had no problem rolling and cutting, it was perfect! I did find that the dipping of the sides of the cookie into white chocolate was slightly difficult. So I used a knife and spread the melted white chocolate across the cookie, each one having a different design. Then I used an icing bag and melted some milk chocolate chips in the microwave. Using a #5 tip, I drizzled the chocolate across the cookies as desired. I then used peppermint flavored sprinkles on some of the cookies!! They were a hit!!"

103876,45069,2013-01-04,5,"I made this chili last night and my family loved it!  I didn't have time for the crockpot, so just cooked on top of the stove for about an hour instead.  I left out the tomatoes since the kids don't like to see them in their chili and just added a little water to compensate.  I love the texture that is created by blending one can of beans - makes it more saucy.  I also liked the spice combination.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for posting!"

1108749,353484,2010-06-29,5,"This was so yummy!  I had my 16 year old son make this and it was wonderful (he is a culinary student).  We used a few strips of turkey bacon cut up then cooked in place of the bacon bits.  I also used a tex-mex seasoning I make that is salt free instead of the southwest seasoning as that is what I had on hand.  I served it with baked red potatoes and steamed green beans.  It was way better than the full fat/calorie versions that I have had in the past. So easy, quick and tasty. Thanks for posting this,  it will be a regular at my house."
2003761,364472,2011-10-19,5,I am just now liking Tofu AND Asparagus. I don't know why in all my years that I never would try either of them.  So I'm always looking for recipes for both of them. Trying to get my husband to like them too.  I made this for dinner last nite and it was Excellent!!  I had everything except for the Roma tomatoes so I just opened a can of diced tomatoes and drained off most of the juice.  While we were eating husband kept going on at how good this was. Luckily there was just enough leftovers for the both of us today.                   This is a definate keeper!   Thanks so much.
732911,264474,2008-05-29,5,"This made for a great summertime pasta sauce!  I enjoyed it a lot, though I can't say I followed the recipe closely.  Instead, I used more black pepper, as suggested, and added a chicken bouillon cube and healthy sprinkling of garlic powder.  Because of the amount of garlic I used and bouillon, I omitted salt.  I also kept it rather chunky, more the consistency of a salsa than a sauce. Parmesan was good, but not needed for a full flavor.   Definitely, definitely adding this to my repertoire."
424680,373377,2009-06-01,5,"A WONDERFUL SALSA! I especially enjoyed the combo of peach, mango & jicama, & the only change I made to it was to reduce the amount of jalapeno by almost half!

After I removed the skin I scored the meat to let the marinade seep in a bit, which made it even more moist. Also, I couldn't help but throw in a tiny bit of garlic with the marinade--it just seemed to beg for it. I completely forgot about the sesame seeds, though--Doh! Next time, I guess. There will definitely be a next time! Thanks for posting."

1910240,228870,2011-05-17,5,Great recipe!  The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the letter and it was fantastic.  The next time I added a little extra garlic and some smoked paprika.  I also subbed a 1 TBSP of New Mexico chili powder for 1 TBSP of the ancho powder for a different subtle kick.  Thanks so much for this recipe and a great way to enjoy chorizo flavor without the fat & calories.  It's awesome with eggs and a little cilantro and green onion.  Just like being back home in Texas!

15077,133315,2006-01-07,2,"Sorry, just did not like the taste of this at all.  I guess I just learned I dont like fava beans and it was a bit bland.  This dish may be beacuse it's not to my taste even though I like parsley and all the other ingredients.  None of the family liked it."

Since I already knew I love the flavor combination of coconut milk, curry & ginger, I was pretty sure it wouldn't disappoint, and it was indeed great. I cooked an extra carrot's worth of carrot slices & added those to the already pureed soup along with some leftover chicken. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get my hands on fresh cilantro and had to rely on dried; as a result the cilantro had almost no impact on the flavor. Hopefully, I can rectify that the next time I make this."

61712,30209,2002-11-29,5,I have been looking for a recipe that produces the kind of BBQ turkey drumsticks that they serve at the Fall festivals around here. I actually like the way these drumsticks turned out better than the ones I have tried before. The one thing I did a little different was to make 2 batches of the marinade. I am funny about using  marinade that poultry has been soaking in to also cook with. So I had a fresh batch to put in the foil pouches and baste with. The meat was tender and not hard to pull of the bone. Great flavor. Thanks Nurse Di for sharing this recipe.

I made this entire recipe including the frosting and everything turned out great I will make these again.  One tip I can give is that I don't use flour when rolling them out I use powdered sugar I think it gives them better flavor.
23018,9836,2002-03-08,2,"I don't know why this recipe scored so highly in the reviews.  It was bland. It lacked flavor.  next time I would add bacon, onions, red pepper, green pepper."

It is a bit cardamom heavy (in future I may or may not use half the amount), but your recipe title lets people know that it is supposed to be a dominant flavour. This will certainly be a go-to recipe for me when I have salmon steaks. We especially loved the spice mixture and the ease of preparation. Thanks for sharing your creativity."
328441,13716,2006-09-01,5,"Count my voice among the many others praising this amazing recipe! Many thanks to Grandma Angelita and to Bergy for posting the recipe. 
I have been searching for a long time for a good sourdough bread recipe. I was looking for a type of bread that was healthy and that would work well for sandwiches and toast, something crusty on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside.

Then I discovered Grandma Angelitas bread recipe. I made it for the first time tonight. EUREKA! I have found my sourdough bread recipe! It was even better than I could have hoped for. The outside has a nice crispy crust and the inside is soft and fluffy and DELICIOUS. 

I made 3/4 of the recipe and just baked two LARGE loaves in my 5 lb. bread pans. I used about 4 cups of white bread flour and 6 cups of white whole wheat flour. It took quite a while to rise, about 3 hours for the first rise and about 2 hours for the second rise. I tented the loaves after about 20 minutes of baking because I don't like my crust too dark. Because of the large loaf size, the bread took about 55 minutes to bake.

The only hard part was forcing myself to wait for the bread to cool down before diving into it. When I finally got to try it, I was ecstatic! This is EXACTLY what I have been searching for. My family and I will be enjoying this bread in the future on a regular basis. Thank you again, Bergy!"
237951,130928,2009-07-01,5,We love this chutney (my first attempt at it)!  The only change I made was to substitute jalapeno pepper for the chili pepper.  Smelled wonderful while it cooked and tasted equally wonderful when done.  Thanks for posting.

The batter was very thick and I did have to spread it around the pan a bit. They were light and fluffy, suprisingly rich-tasting and plain tasty. Will be keeping this recipe on hand!"

182720,108564,2005-03-10,5,These muffins were delicious. Instead of using honey I cooked and pureed an apple with cinnamon and 1 tbspn of brown sugar. I also added 1/2 cup of splenda. The sweetness was just right. I used almond flakes for the nuts and I put sultanas in the microwave for 30 seconds in water to plump them up. I had to add some extra oats as it was quite runny but the final product was delish. My Hubby is taking them to work for break time instead of the high sugar muesli bars he used to take.
215062,130564,2008-09-01,5,"I needed to make a desert for a short notice potluck and had some Butterfinger in the freezer, hence the use of this easy recipe. This recipe is similar to a Tollhouse chocolate chip cookie bar with a few little tweaks. I can't say I really know what these taste like in total, as I didn't have one myself, just a little sliver. I can say that the crowd of 12 they were served to inhaled them, although not a terribly picky group by nature. This recipe doesn't really tell you what ""done"" is and when. I can't tell you when either precisely but I did bake until a knife came out pretty much clean from several spots. I had some extra peanut butter that needed to be used for something, so I added it, about a 1/2 cup in total, it made the batter taste good! Mine came out with a firm, moist and chewy texture."

In order to save all of the sauce I will try this again with chicken.  Thank you for posting a very easy to prepare recipe."

However, I tipped them out on to some parchment paper and they turned out fine.  I added some cayenne pepper to the spices which gave it a nice ""bite"" with the sweetness.  So more-ish!  Will definitely do again soon."
95743,50495,2008-05-10,4,"I ended up adding 1c or so broth because it seemed too thick, but with the cover on  steam seemed to thin the sauce further so perhaps it didn't need the addition.  Next time I'd put the cover on and leave it on, avoiding stirring the dumplings.  I think they'd be lighter and fluffier as mine were BEFORE I stirred them.  I added frozen pearl onions and peas."

22015,26887,2002-06-10,5,This was a nice change of pace and looks so pretty.  I too used extra garlic but had to use dry rosemary as I didn't have the fresh.   It still worked out wonderfully.
192581,156341,2007-07-09,5,"My first attempt at this type of seasoning, and I thought this particular recipe was subtle and definitely not too hot.  I rubbed on tofu which I pressed overnight.  Then I added some additional lime sauce to grill.  My recommendation is to add lime sauce for soak overnight, but I really loved this anyway.  I compared to Rita's cajun seasoning, and the cajun was hotter but the jerk was tastier.  Thanks Rita, looking forward to inventive ways to use leftovers (including on veggies)!"

407007,222533,2007-10-06,5,"I thought I reviewed these already, but guess not! they were fantastic! I made mine with light sausage, light cream cheese, and ommitted the refried beans/onions and cut down on the cheese.  they were so velvety good, exactly as described. will definitely make again, probably with the turkey sausage as another reviewer suggested. thanks for a wonderful keeper!"
54827,378954,2009-07-10,5,"This was really yummy, and will become one of my go-to meals. I loved the sweet and savory contrast. Served it over brown rice."
2694065,86705,2013-02-15,5,"Really great easy recipe! Like a previous reviewer, I substituted butter for the shortening, and I also used more flour than the recipe called for to get the dough thick enough that it'd retain the shape of my heart cookie cutter (I made these for Valentine's Day). I skipped the glaze and simply frosted with Nutella and powdered sugar. The doughnuts themselves have a mildly sweet flavor, more like a bread than a doughnut, so I really recommend topping them with a glaze or some type of frosting. They were pleasantly soft and I wouldn't call them moist, but they certainly weren't dry."
158086,281170,2010-03-12,5,I too took that class and it was fabulous.
319943,202703,2008-02-06,5,"Fabulous!  I used only three breasts and am glad of that because I don't think there would have been enough sauce for four.  My crockpot must also be hotter because the third step only took about 3 1/2 hours and then another half hour for step 5.  I noticed it actually boiling on ""low""."
